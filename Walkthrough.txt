                       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Every once in a while you come across a story which, once you've plunged your
mind into it, doesn't let go of you. Soaked with meaning and hidden layers to
explore, it opens up an entire new world. Structured by the laws of our own
existential lives - yet different in all the details - it manages to captivate
and intrigue not only yourself, but generations to come.

The modern age has shaped a landscape in which spaces have been created that
allow people to tell narratives in different ways. Movies and TV-series are
but examples of the wide diversity of media that emerged in the 20th century.
The space in which video games shine has only opened up in recent decades and
by the looks of its main stream of output appears to be in it's puberty.

It opens up fantastic possibilities to craft narratives in ways unseen before
and it's wonderful to witness every once in a while a game that makes full use
of the semantic potential that the videogame medium contains deep down; an
ability to shape a whole unique lifeworld in which one can dwell and live.

That is exactly what Ni no Kuni manages to do. Playing such a videogame means
nothing other than merging your regular 'lifeworld' with an other lifeworld, in
this case a world fully created by human beings. This differs from reading a
book or watching a movie in an important sense, namely that the subject's free
will literally start playing a role; one gets the feeling of *exploring* a
lifeworld rather than being a spectator. Appropriate music has the power to
enhance the intensity of this feeling, and our fancy is pampered by dynamic
and imaginative environments and creatures.

The feeling of exploration is not an unimportant element of video games, and
especially if one already has the expectation to be drawn into another world,
it's a very disappointing experience to find a linear path drawn out for you;
in an almost unlawful fashion are you stripped from a portion of expected
freedom.

Studio Ghibli has managed to create a beautiful lifeworld that will surely
enchant you. In the end, be it in the form of a tragic yet wonderful graphic
novel such as Jimmy Corrigan by C. Ware, or in the shape of a movie like Let The
Right One In, or in the fashion of Ni no Kuni, what really matters is a
lifeworld's ability to charm its visitors in a singular way and leave a lasting
impression to be shared with others. We can safely assure you that Ni no Kuni
lives up to its name: Another World.

While it's the duty of the creator(s) to craft the above potential, it's the
explorer's responsibility to truly do a lifeworld justice. Just like a tourist
ought to take his time exploring a new city in order to discover new things
worthy of attention, so too does a digital lifeworld require proper attention
and efforts. A travel guide for those prepared to undertake this not always
light hearted quest might thus be a welcome subsidiary.

As such, we do not share the opinion that guides take the fun out of games.
It's perfectly understandable should someone want to explore a world all by
themselves at first, but he who wishes to master the art of exploration better
stands on the shoulders of giants before him, to truly turn every turnable
stone. We hope this strategy guide aids you in doing fully justice to the
magnificent lifeworld of Ni no Kuni. It deserves it.

Steve & Johnathan

   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   the area in your immediate vicinity. Press the SELECT button to
              hide it if you like.

 • Local Map - Press the R1 button in the field to show your local map, which
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   shows a bird's eye view of the wider area around you.

               For either map, your next destination is usually marked with a
               YELLOW STAR.

 • Save Yourself - When you are in towns, or traveling the field (read: World
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   Map,) you can save your game by accessing the Main Menu and
                   pressing START.

 • Way of the Waystone - Waystones are the mysterious stones you will come
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   across in your journey that will restore all your HP
                         and MP. These monoliths will also allow you to save
                         your game.

 • Meeting Monsters - You'll encounter many monsters in the field. When they
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   become aware of your presence, a (!) will appear above
   their heads, and they will give chase. Battle will commence when they close
   to within touching distance. Be aware that you can get the first strike in
   battle by approaching them from behind and they don't notice. This works both
   ways, for you and the monsters. In other words, if monsters approach your
   back, they will have the upper hand in battle.

 • Taking Hearts - Should someone prove willing to share a particular virtue
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   with you, you may pocket a piece of heart with the Take Heart
                   spell, which will be stored in the Locket.

 • Giving Hearts - The only way to cure the brokenhearted is to share a piece of
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   heart from one who has an abundance of a particular virtue.
   Once you have a piece of heart, you must use the Give Heart spell to cure the
   brokenhearted.

 • When the Locket glows - As your journey progresses, the Locket will glow upon
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   occasion. It responds to those who have an abundance
   of a virtue; their souls will be highlighted on the Mini Map, so be sure
   collect their pieces of heart.

 • <#09, MISSING>

 • About the Main Menu - Pressing TRIANGLE will access the Main Menu. From
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   there, just use the D-Pad and the CROSS button to make
                         your choices, and CIRCLE to exit altogether.

 • The Bottomless Bag - This bag contains the full array of items you've
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   acquired. Items are divided into different categories,
   and you can use L1 and R1 to switch between them. Consumable items can be
   used there and then by pressing CROSS--ideal for restoring HP and MP.

 • Your Party's Abilities - In the Main Menu, select Friends & Familiars to
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   access your party's information. HP (Health Points)
   represents health, while MP (Magic Points) represents magical power
   available. Movement Speed and Attack Speed are self-explanatory; the more
   STARS you have, the faster you are. Attack determines how strong your
   physical attacks are, while Defense influences the amount of physical damage
   taken. Magical Attack and Magical Defense act the same way, but with magical
   damage. Evasion indicates the chances of avoiding an attack, while Accuracy
   determines how likely your attacks will succeed. Exp. indicates your
   experience level; it will increase as you gain experience, as shown by the
   Exp. to Next Level field.

 • Tricks and Commands - Skills learned by creatures are known as tricks; you
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   can see them by selecting Friends & Familiars in the
   Main Menu. Tricks take up a single command slot, and regardless of how many
   are learned, they can only use a set few in battle; set them by using the
   TRIANGLE button. As for tricks themselves, each familiar can only learn a
   maximum of EIGHT. After that, it must forget old tricks to learn new ones.


                                 TIPS [BSC-3]
                                 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
 • Treasure hunting (towns/dungeons) - As to be expected from an RPG, Ni no Kuni
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   has a lot of treasures for you to find.
   Many of them are hidden in chests, others in pots with sparkling glitter.
   This walkthrough covers all treasure in the game and includes complete item
   lists. Note that some chests are sealed with magic. Later in the game you'll
   be able to open blue chests, and still later, purple and green chests as
   well. This sometimes requires you to backtrack to previous areas. Also note
   that twinkling treasure (such as the ones in pots) will recover their
   contents over time, allowing you to collect treasure from them over and over
   again. It does take about 15 minutes for them to restore the contents, so
   make yourself useful in the meantime.

 • Colored treasure chests - As mentioned above, some chests cannot be opened.
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   These are different in color from the regular, red
   treasure chests. Blue chests require you to have and cast the 'Spring Lock'
   spell, which is acquired early in the game. Purple chests also require the
   Mornstar wand (gotten later in the game). Green chests require you to have
   progressed far enough to have Swaine in your party.

 • Old Father Oak - Be sure to visit Old Father Oak every once in a while to
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   tell him of your adventures and he'll often reward you with
   precious items. This walkthrough tells you exactly when you can expect Mr.
   Oak to hand out new precious treasures.

 • Socializing - It doesn't have to become your hobby, but in Ni no Kuni it's
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   smart to talk to NPC's, visit stores, and rest at each inn.
   The latter will even grant you missing pages from the Wizard's Companion,
   and NPC's sometimes have important information to tell.

 • Approaching Enemies - Ni no Kuni features semi-random battles, and you'll be
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   able to spot creatures from far away, especially on the
   world map, which gives you the opportunity to approach them from behind or
   avoid them altogether. If you manage to sneak up on your enemy, you'll have
   the upper hand in battle, essentially giving you a free round of attacks.
   But if an enemy ambushes you (approaches you from behind), then they will be
   the ones with a free round of attacks. If this happens, run around in battle
   like a headless chicken until you're good to go. If you notice a fast
   creature that you can't outrun is chasing you, it's best to turn around and
   face it like a man; that way you won't have to deal with ambushes.

 • Stunning Enemies - There are times when you'll want to avoid enemies on the
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   world map, especially when you're exploring an island
   that you aren't really supposed to explore to get collect some really nice
   treasures. In such cases it's good to know that there's a little trick that
   might just save your hide once or twice. Whenever you pick up a (hidden)
   treasure on the world map, including the ones from forage points, enemies
   are briefly stunned. This is to grant you time to pick up the item. However,
   the stun lasts slightly longer than the instant Oliver himself is immobile.
   Don't cancel the text box; simply run away in the direction you want to
   move, giving you a small headstart.
   
   This trick can also be performed by talking to Drippy on the world map, but
   that requires a little more skill. Nonetheless, since Drippy is almost always
   available, there's plenty enough room for practice!

 • Elementary Elements - In Ni no Kuni there are six categories in which damage
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   can be place: five elemental affinities, and Physical
   damage. The elements are Fire, Water, Storm, Light and Darkness. If you
   manage to exploit an enemy's elemental weakness, you'll do roughly +50%
   damage, indicated by orange numbes. If an enemy resists the element you're
   using, blue figures will mark this. Be sure to consult this walkthrough for
   tips on when to exploit creature's elemental weaknesses. You can use skills
   that are element-laden, but there are also weapons with this feature.
   You'll also want to defend yourself against enemies' elemental tricks
   whenever possible. Some familiars have elemental weaknesses and resistances,
   so keep track of those; especially right before boss battles.

 • Status Ailments - Enemies - especially strong foes - sometimes have the
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   ability to inflict status ailments upon you and your
   familiars. Below is a table with their effects, duration and cure. All status
   ailments are automatically lifted after battle.

 • Stamina in battles - While your main characters can be used as long as you'd
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   like, familiars have a stamina bar (displayed round
   their icon in battle) that will sooner or later be depleted. When this
   happens, their stats will be impaired and it takes longer for the stamina
   bar to fill up than normal, so it's usually for the better to call your
   familiar back when it's about to run out of energy, swapping it for another.

 • Defend, Evade & Psyche-Up - While each main character always has the Defend
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   command at their disposal (which lasts for
   several seconds and halves damage) some familiars have this replaced with
   either the Evade or Psyche-Up commands. Evade is similar in execution to
   Defend, except it lasts much shorter so you'll need to time it rather
   precisely. If successfully done, you'll evade the attack without taking any
   damage whatsoever. The Psycho-Up command works differently. Using this will
   cause the familiar to charge up their energy; after this, their regular
   attack command changes into the 'Go Wild' command, which allows them to
   attack more frequently and more forcefully. While these familiars lack the
   Defend skill, they can (sometimes) nonetheless cancel enemy attacks when
   they're ravaging them during their frenzy. This isn't guaranteed, however,
   so it's always a bit of a risk you're taking.

 • Cancelling enemy attacks - When an enemy is performing a trick, repeatedly
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   bashing it with attacks of your own may stagger
   your foe, cancelling their attack. The chance that this happens isn't very
   high, although you can increase this by using the Go Wild command (if
   available to you). Cancelling enemy attacks basically falls under the
   category, 'offense is the best defense'. While sometimes true, it's
   certainly not always the case, since some enemy tricks can't be cancelled
   at all.

 • Counterattacking - It's possible to perform a counterattack on foes by
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   waiting with entering the attack command until you notice
   your enemy is going to attack you. At that time, your attack command should
   flash blue for an instant; quickly press it to counter your enemy's attack,
   leaving them stunned, cancelling their own attack. It's especially hard to
   counterattack swift enemies' attacks, but it's certainly not essential to
   attempt this anyway.

 • Glims on the battlefield - As you're fighting off enemies, green and blue
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   glims will occassionally appear. The green ones
   heal a small portion of your HP while the blue ones heal some of your
   MP. It's a good idea to grab these whenever possible so you can save your
   precious healing items.

 • Golden Glims & Miracle Moves - When you've performed reasonably well in a 
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   battle - usually longer boss battles - you
   might find a golden glim on the battlefield. Be sure to immediately collect
   these, since they don't hang around forever. It'll complete restore your
   health and grants access to your character's or familiar's Miracle Move,
   a limit break-like attack that usually does massive damage, although some
   inflict status effects or provide a splendid healing of your party. The best
   way to generate a gold glim is to stun an enemy/boss by exploiting their
   weak spot, although defending against tricks also tends to work well. See
   the table below for more information on generating glims.

.—————————————————————————————.——————————————————————————————————.—————————————.
|ACTION:                      |CHANCE FOR GENERATING HP/MP GLIMS:|GOLDEN GLIMS:|
|=============================|==================================|=============|
|Stun enemy (exploit weakness)|               High               |     High    |
|Defend against a Boss trick  |               High               |    Average  |
|Critical Hits                |           Moderate/High          |      Low    |

'—————————————————————————————'——————————————————————————————————'—————————————'

 • Post-battle fun: Health & Magic Glims - It's a good idea in general to snatch
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   the green health and blue magic glims
   from the battlefield, but it doesn't have to end when all foes have been
   defeated. If there are any glims nearby, you'll still have a second or so
   left to grab these, granting you free HP and MP.

 • Keeping 'em imprisoned - Once you get your second teammember it becomes
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   possible to catch familiars. Be sure to do so
   whenever the opportunity arises! You never know when the beasties may come
   in handy, during the various errands of the game for example.

 • Losing isn't fun - But it's not the end of the (another) world either.
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   Instead, it'll cost you 10% of your Guilders to revive
   your party. Obviously the best remedy is not to lose, and if you've recently
   saved your game, reloading is an option. But if you'd otherwise lose too much
   progress, definitely consider paying the price to cheat death, unless you're
   attempting some kind of challenge run or perfect game.

 • Battle Spoils & Thievery - Most enemies in the game have a common and a rare
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   drop, which roughly vary between 10-25% and 2-5%
   respectively in chance. Once you get Swaine in your party, stealing items
   from creatures becomes an option. Again, enemies have a common and a rare
   item that you can steal, which vary roughly between 20-35% and 5-25%
   respectively. Many items can only or mainly be gotten from creatures.

 • Healing up - It's a good idea to keep your health high at all times. An
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   additional reason for this is that your MP bar tends to be
   full(er) if you refrain from using powerful magic against regular foes;
   these still drop MP glims, however, which would go to waste if you're already
   powered up magic-wise.

 • Errands (sidequests) - Once you reach the first town in Another World, you'll
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯    be able to run errands for several citizens. You can
   start an errand either by heading to Swift Solutions (in which errands and
   bounties are sorted all together), or by speaking to individual citizens
   themselves. The rewards vary, but as a rule of thumb it's always best to do
   errands as soon as they become available, because your compensation won't be
   so rewarding when you complete them later in the game.

 • Bounty Hunting - Similar to errands, bounty hunting requires you to deal with
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   a certain fiend that's usually bothering or endangering
   NPC's. You're given an indication as where to look for the critters, and this
   walkthrough has detailed information available on each and every bounty as
   they become available to you.

 • Merit Cards, Stamps & Rewards - Errands and bounties grant you 'merit stamps'
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   besides just decent rewards. Once you fill up
   a merit card you can exchange it for rewards at Swift Solutions, or save it
   up for more pricey rewards. Note that after approximately 10 tasks you'll be
   given a bonus stamp. Once you pass the 100 tasks, these bonuses become
   larger. There are exactly enough stamps to purchase all rewards.

 • Full Fledged Alchemist - Once you unlock alchemy it becomes possible to mix
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   items into better ones via recipes. You'll be able
   to get recipes from NPC's, but you don't necessarily need to have an in-game
   recipe ready to be a good alchemist. In fact, you can also try to mix and
   match items; if it doesn't work out, you'll get to keep the items. This guide
   lists all possible recipes for you.

 • Twinkling Forage Locations - These twinkling stars are markers for spots on
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   the world map that contain items. They're not
   quite the same as hidden treasures, because these twinkling locations will
   recover their treasure over time. Come back after a while to harvest more.

 • (Hidden) Treasures on the World Map - There are many treasures to be found on
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   the world map. If you find 100 of them,
   you'll be awarded a Silver Trophy, but the treasures themselves are usually
   worth your trouble by themselves. You'll eventually get a spell that makes
   the hidden treasures visible, but it's advisable to follow this walkthrough
   with tips on where to find them, since if you wait too long, their usefulness
   will be greatly diminished due to better available equipment you've gathered.

 • (Hidden) World Map Locations - We've gone over hidden treasures, but like a
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   proper J-RPG, Ni no Kuni also features hidden
   locations on the world map. Hints are usually given in the game by NPC's or
   in some other fashion, and this walkthrough will leave none of them
   unexplored. Regardless, there are roughly two types of hidden areas: forest
   zones and caves. Carefully search forests and explore mountains to see if you
   can spot them by yourselves.


                               FAMILIARS [BSC-4]
                               ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
 • Familiar Signs - Depending on what sign your familiar has, they'll receive
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   bonuses against specific elemental attacks and status
   ailments. But there's more. The Sun - Moon - Star triangle is especially
   important to memorize: Sun beats Moon beats Star beast Sun. When a sign beats
   an other sign, it means the familiar deals +20% to that enemy. However, if
   a sign loses from an other sign (such as, Sun loses from Star), then that
   Sun familiar deals -20% to the Star familiar (while the Star enemy deals +20%
   damage to your familiar).

   The Planet and Double Planet signs are exceptions to this triangle. A Planet
   sign is neutral to the three regular signs, but deals +50% damage to the
   Double Planet sign. The Double Planet sign is an all-round sign, dealing +10%
   damage to all three normal signs (including the 'Double' ones), and no
   additional damage to the Planet sign.

          .—————————————.———————————————————————————————————————————.
          |SIGN TYPE:   |EFFECT:                                    |
          |=============|===========================================|
          |Sun          |+5% Fire resistance and Sleep ailment      |
          |Double Sun   |+10% Fire resistance and Sleep ailment     |
          |Moon         |+5% Water resistance and Confusion ailment |
          |Double Moon  |+10% Water resistance and Confusion ailment|
          |Star         |+5% Storm resistance and Poison ailment    |
          |Double Star  |+10% Storm resistance and Poison ailment   |
          |Planet       |+5% EXP bonus                              |
          |Double Planet|+10% EXP bonus                             |
          '—————————————'———————————————————————————————————————————'

   It's important to know that many strong creatures you'll face are of the
   Sun sign (including many bounties), which makes the Star sign a good choice
   for your familiars. Obviously the Planet and Double Planet signs are good
   as well, but they're also considerably more rare.

 • Gaining experience - Each party member can hold three familiars with them to
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   use at any time in battle, plus an additional three
   'reserves' which you can select from the menu when you're not in a battle.
   The three active familiars - the ones selectable in battle - will always
   receive the full battle experience spoils, so it's an excellent idea to have
   a strong familiar that you use often, level up an other familiar or two in
   the other slots.

 • Feeding Familiars - You can feed familiars treats, which boost their primary
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   ability, as well as their familiarity (or love for you).
   A familiar can only eat 10 treats at a time; by then all their stomach slots
   are filled, which means calories need some burning. This is done by battling,
   and each battle you fight empties a stomach slot of all your familiars (it
   doesn't matter if they fight themselves or not).

   A familiar's six stats/abilities can be boosted for a maximum of 50 points
   (for all stats combined). Moreover, you're only allowed to boost a familiar's
   stats 10 points for each familiarity heart you've completely filled up. If
   you've filled up two hearts, that means you can boost a familiar's stats for
   a total of 20; you can go past it by filling the next heart. There are five
   familiarity hearts, hence the maximum is a stat boost of 50. Boosting the
   hearts is also done by feeding familiars treats.

   There are various treat types, as well as stronger versions of a type which
   grant double the regular boost. Each familiar has a favorite treat. Feeding
   it that specific type will double the familiarity bonus it receives. You can
   know when a familiar likes a treat when pink hearts appear above their head
   when eating.

 • Catching Familiars - Once Esther joins your ranks and you've finished the
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   Temple of Trials, it becomes possible to catch new
   familiars. This is done by whacking monsters as usual, but sometimes -
   depending on the creature there's roughly a 4-25% chance that this happens -
   a bunch of pink hearts will appear above the creature, indicating it's
   fallen in love with you and is ready to be seduced. Immediately stop
   attacking it and have Esther perform the Serenade to catch it.

 • A Genius knows all Genuses - Each familiar belongs to a genus, of which there
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   are 14 in total. Each genus has their own
   typical strengths and weaknesses, and are most compatible with one of your
   main characters. Below is an overview of basic genus information.

 • Familiar Growth - Each familiar has a specific growth pattern, kind of like
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   us humans in some respects. There are three patterns of
   growth: 1. Early; 2. Normal; 3. Late. A familiar with an early growth pattern
   will excel between levels 1-40, slow down at that point between levels 40-60,
   and perform significantly below average between levels beyond that (60-99).
   A familiar with an average growth pattern will show a steady grow, but even
   though they're stronger at later levels than early risers, they're still
   worse than late bloomers. Late Bloomers will perform below average until
   approximately level 80, at which point their stats skyrocket upwards, leaving
   everyone else behind.

   As one might've guessed, early risers are particularly good in the beginning
   of the game, average growers are useful for beginning/mid-game, while late
   bloomers are especially useful when you're ready to max out your party and
   do all optional quests in the game.

 • Familiar Metamorphosis - Each familiar has a family (what's in a name) and
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   has the potential to metamorphose into a different
   form. Yes, it's Pokemonesque, but the system isn't entirely the same either.

   Each familiar can transform into a second form, which is always the same.
   But the next metamorphosis, to the third (and final) form depends on your
   choice out of two possible transformations. The most salient differences
   between these last two forms are elemental differences, growth pattern and
   types of tricks. Detailed information on all this will be of later concern.

   Familiars typically transform for the first time somewhere between level 10
   and 20. The next metamorphosis is normally possible some 10-15 levels later.
   For the first metamorphosis, your familiar needs to be fed a sign-compatible
   drop, for example, a star familiar requires a star drop. The transformation
   to its last form requires a more powerful type of the same drop.

   It's very important to realize that a metamorphosis also bumps your
   familiar's level back to 1. Admittedly, high-level familiars that transform
   into a second or third form do have somewhat higher stats (around 10-20
   points, give or take), which makes the question simple: do you want your
   specific familiar to be strong early in the game, or late in the game.
   Depending on where you are at, and also depending on the familiar's growth
   pattern, you'll want to choose wisely. Early in the game it's best to
   transform familiars as soon as possible, but you should never do this to ALL
   of them at once, or you'll be stuck with a team of fairly weak level 1
   critters; cute, yet useless. It's better to keep at least one high-level
   familiar as your primary member while having two other 'active' members that
   can profit from the experience gains as well.

   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

MOTORVILLE [WLK-1.1]
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
ITEMS: [ ] Oliver's Clothes, [ ] Fairy Suit, [ ] The Wizard's Companion,
¯¯¯¯¯¯ [ ] Old Stick

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

You'll start in Motorville with a tutorial on moving; run over to Philip and
talk to him to proceed. Afterward, you'll be introduced to the mini map and
local map as well, so use them to locate the yellow star on the map: Oliver's
house, which is to the south and west of your current location.

Watch the scenes here, then you'll regain control at night. You'll be given a
quick tutorial on the Main Menu, as well as saving your game, so go ahead and go
to the Main Menu, then press START to save! Easy enough!

NOTE: You begin with [OLIVER'S CLOTHES] and a [FAIRY SUIT] in your Important
¯¯¯¯¯ Items of your bag.

Leave the house and make your way to Phil's garage, as marked on your mini map.
Watch the scene on the way there, then make sure the coast is clear to your
west and south before triggering another very long set of scenes. After those
are finally out of the way, you'll regain control inside your house.

Head downstairs and check out the fireplace, where you'll uncover the mighty
tome, [THE WIZARD'S COMPANION]! Go ahead and put your name (or anything else you
like) inside of it, then it's off to find something brown and sticky--like a
stick--to substitute for a magic wand!

NOTE: With The Wizard's Companion now in hand, you'll be able to collect
¯¯¯¯¯ different pages from all around the world to put inside of it. They'll
      help you along your journey, anywhere from spells to bestiary entries
      to just fun little stories.

Drippy will be your destination/guide, so follow him around for a couple of
stops, talking to him whenever he stops leading you. Along the way, you'll learn
more about the Bottomless Bag that will contain all of the items you come across
in your journey. Afterward, make your way east for another short scene, where
you'll then have to talk to the green-haired girl from earlier. Thanks to her,
you'll then obtain the [OLD STICK] you need!

You now need an open space to cast the Gateway spell, so make your way north,
east, and north to the town square. Here, your Spells menu will automatically
pop up (in the future, you need only press the SQUARE button to open it,) so go
ahead and choose 'Gateway' to set up a gate to the other world!


WORLD MAP EXPLORATION - ROLLING HILLS [WLK-1.2]
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
ITEMS: [ ] White Bread x3, [ ] Supple Leather, [ ] Pie x2, [ ] Sour Sundae,
¯¯¯¯¯¯ [ ] Chocolate x2, [ ] Wooden Sword, [ ] White Bread x3, [ ] Cake x2,
       [ ] Giant's Tooth, [ ] Well-Worn Sword, [ ] Supple Leather,
       [ ] Iced Coffee

*ITEMS: [ ] Booster Shoots, [ ] Plainswort Flower, [ ] Springwater,
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ [ ] Booster Shoots, [ ] Plainswort Flower, [ ] Springwater,

ENEMIES: Ruff, Sleepeafowl, Rhinosaur, Inphant, Minor Byrde, Baatender, Oroboros
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
As soon as you arrive in the other world, you'll have to take on a Ruff! Don't
worry, Drippy will make sure you don't become puppy chow; follow the tutorial,
and you'll do fine.

NOTE: After the scene here, you'll automatically get the "Out of this World"
¯¯¯¯¯ trophy for making it to the other world.

When you regain control, you'll be given [WHITE BREAD x3] by Drippy. Now, there
are quite a few items that can be had here on the World Map... However, let us
make a quick stop at our destination first... after grabbing a couple of quick
treasures!

TIP: You can view the world map by pressing R1. This should help with finding
¯¯¯¯ treasures and specific locations.

IMPORTANT: An * indicates a twinkling forage point; these restore their contents
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ over time. A • indicate a unique treasure.

 * Just to the west on the hill you are on has some twinkling stars; check them
   out for a bunch of [BOOSTER SHOOTS].

 • On the northwestern side of this hill is a skeleton and a set of three large
   bones sticking out of the ground; examine the area around the middle bone to
   find some [SUPPLE LEATHER]. (Note: On your map these bones are displayed as
   the southern-most skeleton.)

NOTE: All twinkling stars on the World Map will respawn after a set amount of
¯¯¯¯¯ time has passed. These items are marked with an asterisk (*) in the
      item listing above.

Once you have those, proceed northeast to the entrance of Ding Dong Dell. After
a quick tutorial on changing your viewpoint, enter the castle. Your visit inside
is extremely short; after just one scene, head back out on the World Map. Your
new destination is now the Deep Dark Wood to the far north.

Now it's time to gather the rest of the treasure!

 * Directly southeast of Ding Dong Dell, along the eastern mountains, is another
   set of twinkling stars; examine these to get a [PLAINSWORT FLOWER].

 • Just to the south-southwest of those stars is a hill in the shape of an 'S',
   with a small forest in the top hook (on the lower plains); search this
   forest for [PIE x2].

 * Just to the northeast of Ding Dong Dell is a very small pond with a waterfall
   letting out to the south. On the eastern side of it are some twinkling stars;
   examine them to receive some [SPRINGWATER].

 • On the western side of that small pond check the waterfall to find a
   [SOUR SUNDAE].

 • Just northeast of the small pond is a chasm with a body of water at the
   bottom, and there are two sets of woods just to the east of them, but up on
   a higher level. Examine the lone tree on the southwest part of the northern
   woods to find [CHOCOLATE x2].

 • On the western side of the lake surrounding the city is a small peninsula;
   search nearby the waterfall to find a [WOODEN SWORD].

 * To the far west of Ding Dong Dell, tucked away in the southwestern corner
   below a body of water, is a small set of trees with some twinkling stars;
   examine the stars to receive another bunch of [BOOSTER SHOOTS].

 • Just to the northeast of those stars is a skeleton beside a hill; search the
   nearby (eastern) edge on the top of this hill to find [WHITE BREAD x3].

 • Look at your local map; to the northwest of Ding Dong Dell is a set of two
   bones sticking out of the ground just to the right of a hill. (It's just
   south of what looks like a giant rib cage near a river.) Make your way to
   those bones, and you'll see that there are actually three of them; check the
   ground there to find [CAKE x2].

 * Directly east/northeast from these bones, alongside the eastern mountains,
   you'll see some more twinkling stars; examine these, and you'll receive
   another [PLAINSWORT FLOWER].

 • To the far north from here, you'll see the river dumping into a lake; if you
   check the very topmost southeastern side of it beside the trees, you'll find
   a [GIANT'S TOOTH] accessory.

 * Head south and follow the river stream west. When it ends in a large pond
   with high mountains nearby, check the northern side of the river to spot
   twinkling stars. These ones will give you a [SPRINGWATER].

 • From the southern side of the river, go west, then north past the pond/lake
   onto the northern side of it to get under a rock formation, high above the
   water; check the eastern side of the trees - between the pillar and rock wall
   - to find a [WELL-WORN SWORD].

 • To the west is a bridge; cross it, then check where the brook meets the edge
   of the trees near the waterfall to find some [SUPPLE LEATHER].

 • Northwest of here, look for a set of three large singular bones sticking out
   of the ground. Check the ground to find a bottle of [ICED COFFEE].

Once you have all of these treasures, feel free to battle monsters for a while
if you please. Otherwise, you're ready to enter the Deep Dark Wood!

As you enter, you'll learn about waystones, which will not only recover your
HP and MP upon examining it, but it will also allow you to save your game. There
is also a plate on the ground next to it, but we can't do anything with it yet.
Save, then follow Drippy to the northeast and continue down the trail past
the fork to meet Old Father Oak!

During the scene you'll receive the page [FORM FAMILIAR] for your Wizard's
Companion, which will now allow you to summon familiars to do your bidding! With
that, your Spell Menu will open. Cast 'Form Familiar' and the Mite will join
your party as Oliver's first familiar. In addition to that, Old Father Oak will
also give you the [HEALING TOUCH] spell, as well as the [FIREBALL] spell for
your Wizard's Companion. Immediately cast it on the fellow and watch him wither
away.. No, you're actually not allowed to do that, but surely the thought
crossed your mind.

With new abilities comes a new tutorial battle, so follow along carefully and
wipe out the Teeny Boppers with your new familiar. After the fight, learn more
about taking care of and upgrading your familiars, then go ahead and equip the
Mite with the Well-Worn Sword you found out on the World Map. While you are at
it, give Oliver the Giant's Tooth accessory that you found.

When you're ready, head back south to the fork that you passed and head down
the right/northeastern path, opening the first chest you see for a loaf of
[WHITE BREAD]. Simply follow the path into the next area, the Whispering
Waterfalls.

Use the Waystone along the way to recover your HP and MP and save. Keep
following the path, and after jumping across some stones in the river, you'll
come to a second chest that's just to your right. Open it to find a bar of
[CHOCOLATE], then continue on, battling beasties along the way.

You'll soon come to another fork; ignore the path to the southwest (it contains
a sealed chest that we can't open yet, so we'll come back to it later,) and
instead, jump across the rocks to the southeast (initially your left). You'll
get another quick tutorial on assigning new tricks to familiars; continue down
the path afterwards and keep your eyes open for a chest to your left/southwest
with another loaf of [WHITE BREAD] inside.

Take a few steps back to the fork, then head southeast. Continue along the path
until you come to a tree stump; there's another chest at its base, so open it
for a bottle of [ICED COFFEE]. That's it for treasures here! You're currently at
a fork, but going east will take you back to where you opened the last chest, so
continue west instead to reach another Waystone. Make sure to save!

When you're ready, take a few steps south, where you'll encounter the giant
Guardian of the Woods! Yikes!

  STATS:   152 HP, Weak against: Fire, Resists: Storm

Even though you can use the Mite to fight for you, it is recommended staying as
Oliver; his Fireball spell will do more damage much more quickly than the little
familiar can dish out.

In fact, all you'll need to do is spam your Fireball spell against the big lug
by choosing Spells, then Fireball. When you get low on MP, be sure to look for
any blue glims on the battlefield, but stay far away from the Guardian otherwise
to minimize threats.

When the Guardian prepares for its Windfall attack you'll be warned to Defend in
order to minimize damage. Once you defend against this attack twice, you'll be
told that you have a Chance to do some major damage, so when that happens,
CANCEL your defense with CIRCLE and quickly nail him with another Fireball.

He will also use the Bellow spell; this doesn't do any damage, but it will stun
you to where you can't do anything, and he will usually follow it up with
Windfall, so be sure to defend against it so you can avoid the status effect.

If Oliver drops below 20 HP, be sure to cast your Healing Touch spell to
rejuvenate yourself (or even use some White Bread, if you prefer not to spend
your MP.) Should you run out of MP completely, and Iced Coffee might just help
you get through the fight, although it normally shouldn't be necessary.

As the battle nears its end, you'll be told of a 'gold glim' that appears; once
you see one of these beauties on the field, be sure to run over and quickly
grab it! It'll restore all of your HP, and it will also allow you to perform a
Miracle Move that doesn't use any MP! Once you get this one, perform that move
and end this battle with a bang!

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

After the battle, you'll automatically receive the page [THE GUARDIAN OF THE
WOODS], as well as [THE SECOND TALE] of Wonder.

NOTE: After defeating the Guardian of the Woods, you'll receive the
¯¯¯¯¯ "En Guardian!" trophy.

After the battle and upon your return to Old Father Oak, you'll be able to
access the Telling Stone from the menu. You'll receive a [LOCKET] from him,
as well as the [TAKE HEART] and [GIVE HEART] spells.

Once you regain control, make your way to the exit and head back out to the
World Map. Next stop: Ding Dong Dell!

Once you enter the city and watch the scene, talk to the active doorman, and
he'll let you take some of his enthusiasm! You'll automatically open your magic
menu, so choose 'Take Heart' to use it on the doorman. Once you have his
enthusiasm, approach the other doorman and talk to him; again, with your magic
menu open, choose 'Give Heart' to give him the first doorman's enthusiasm!

With that, you'll now gain access to the city after a few scenes. Start making
your way northwest, but before going through the archway, check the urn to the
left of the arch for [5 - 15 G]. Now go through the arch for a scene, where
you'll decide that you need a new outfit. Just to the north and east of where
you are is the Hootique, so stop in and talk to Hootenanny. She does have some,
but you'll have to wait til the morning before you can get it, so now's the time
to check out elsewhere.

First stop will be Swift Solutions; it's to your south and west. Inside, you'll
learn about different tasks that you can take on, as well as different bounty
hunts that you can partake. You'll then receive a Merit Stamp Cards from the
taskmaster; fill them up, and you can exchange them for rewards at any Swift
Solutions location! With that, you can now access your own Journal to see how
you're progressing in the story, as well as check out your various side tasks.
Check out the errand board for new errands and inquire about bounties at the
taskmaster.

NOTE: Whenever new tasks or bounties appear, and they are able to be (easily)
¯¯¯¯¯ completed, we will suggest completing them via the Errands / Bounties
      box, as seen below. For completion's sake, we recommend doing them as
      they're listed in the walkthrough.

| To begin this errand, talk to the grimalkin (cat-lady) at the far north end  |
| of the first area of Ding Dong Dell, and she'll tell you she lost one of her |

| To begin this errand, talk to the grimalkin (cat-lady) in the center of the  |
| first area of Ding Dong Dell, on the northern bridge connecting the eastern  |
| and western sides. She'll ask you to retrieve two Springwaters and two       |
| Plainswort Flowers.                                                          |

| If you already pillaged all of the treasures from the World Map in the Ding  |
| Dong Dell area once, you should have both sets of items, but if not, you'll  |
| need to visit the areas with twinkling stars on the World Map to obtain      |
| these.                                                                       |

| • Directly southeast of Ding Dong Dell, along the eastern mountains, is      |
|   another set of twinkling stars; examine these to get a [PLAINSWORT FLOWER].|
|                                                                              |
| • Just to the northeast of Ding Dong Dell is a very small pond with a        |
|   waterfall letting out to the south. On the eastern side of it are some     |
|   twinkling stars; examine them to receive some [SPRINGWATER].               |
|                                                                              |
| • North of Ding Dong Dell, alongside the eastern mountains, but south of the |
|   northernmost lake, you'll see some more twinkling stars; examine these,    |
|   and you'll receive another [PLAINSWORT FLOWER].                            |
|                                                                              |
| • From that last flower, head west along the nearby river that starts at the |
|   northernmost lake, but ends in a pond to the west. Before it ends into     |
|   another pond/lake, check on the northern side of the river to see some     |
|   more twinkling stars. These ones will give you another [SPRINGWATER].      |
|                                                                              |
| Once you've given the four items to her, you'll receive a [WOODEN SHIELD]    |
| and [50 G] for your assistance! Make sure to equip the shield to Mite.       |

|______________________________________________________________________________|


When you're done with the optional errands and bounties, feel free to explore
the town a little and proceed with the main storyline.

On the southern side of the Swift Solutions building is a twinkling urn with [10
G], so grab it, then head south and hug the wall as you go southeast. You should
find another twinkling urn; examine it for some [ICE CREAM]. Next, head (north)
east from Swift Solutions and head through the gate. When you see the road widen
just a bit on both sides, check the northern side for yet another twinkling urn,
this time with a loaf of [WHITE BREAD].

To your east is the Cawtermaster's Store; head inside first and open the chest
there for a [SUNDAE], then return outside and check the leafy area to the
immediate south to find another chest behind a tree, this time with a bottle
of [ICED COFFEE].

Next up, head to the Cat's Cradle, which is the first building to the north
after entering the city. Examine the twinkling urn here for some [CAKE], then
talk to the purrprietor to stay overnight for a measly 10 G. By staying here,
you will also unlock a Regions of the World page, [THE SUMMERLANDS: NORTH]!

Leave the Cat's Cradle and make your way back to the Hootique, where you'll
receive a set of [TRAVELER'S CLOTHES]. Now that you look the part, you can see
the King! Proceed north to the second area of the city.

Just a few steps forward after entering, look to your right/east to find a
twinkling urn; this one has a [POISON-BE-GONE]. Head north a bit, just up the
stairs and past the fountain, then turn east and check the southeastern corner
of this area to find a chest containing a loaf of [WHITE BREAD].

Make your way further east by going through the archway to the Grave of the
Sage, then by going southeast. In the area just to the south of the actual
grave, check out the twinkling urn here for a slice of [PIE].

Next, make your way to the actual Grave of the Sage. Check behind the stone to
find a boy. He can't talk, but he'll give you the [SPIRIT MEDIUM] spell, at
which point, you'll need to turn around and cast the 'Spirit Medium' spell
itself back onto him. With it, you can now talk to him and learn more about
the boy--Horace, the Sage of Ages! You'll see him again later on.

Head back to the square and proceed north, talking to the guards here to find
out that we can't actually see the King. Why? Well, one of his aides lost his
precious red herring, so now we have to find it before we can do anything. Head
back to south Ding Dong Dell so we can start looking.

Just to the north of Swift Solutions is a dock; Drippy will spot the red
herring, so hop on the wooden poles to have Oliver spot the fish himself, only
to have it retreat back toward the palace, so get back to dry land and head back
to north Ding Dong Dell.

Go back to the Grave of the Sage, where you'll actually catch the red herring
in shallow water. With Drippy holding on to the floppy fish, run back to the
guards at the palace entrance to hand the fish over. Doing so grants you the
audience with the King, so watch the scene inside the palace before you're left
back in town with more questions than answers.

Enter the Telling Stone! He tells you that the Locket will glow when there are
people nearby with pieces of heart that you need, so when you regain control,
hop back down to south Ding Dong Dell. Your target is in the northeastern corner
of the area, just before the stairs leading down to a watery area. Talk to the
boy with the broom, then use 'Take Heart' to get his extra enthusiasm.

With that in hand, make your way back to the palace and talk to the King once
more, choosing 'Give Heart' when the Spell Menu pops up to finally bring King
Tom back to his normal self. He will reward you with his wand--once he finds
it--but in the mean time, you'll receive the [SPRING LOCK] spell and the
[REJUVENATE] spell from him.

Travel back to the south end of Ding Dong Dell. First, stop inside the Hootique
and check out the chest on the north side of the room; open your Spell Menu and
choose 'Spring Lock' to spring the chest open for a [SANDWICH]! Next, pay a
visit to the Cawtermaster's Store. You'll learn more about equipping your
familiars (which you should have already done with the Mite's weapon that we
found) and you'll also finally be able to shop. There's nothing worth grabbing
just yet (as we either already found or will soon find suitable equipment), so
leave the shop and head back to the palace to claim your prize.

As chance would have it, as the King was looking for the wand, he mysteriously
disappeared, so we have to go searching once again to figure out where he went.
Thanks to Drippy's keen brain, we'll start looking in Motorville, so open your
Spell Menu and choose Gateway to reopen the gate back to Motorville.


To Motorville
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Here, visit Leila's shop and talk to her to find out Timmy's gone missing as
well. Head over to the front of Oliver's house to meet the green-haired girl
once again; she'll finally introduce herself as Pea, and she'll lead you to
Timmy. Follow her as she leads you around in a roundabout way to the south end
of town to the striped feline. Drippy will load the cat onto his back, so lead
the way back to Leila's to help him out.

With Timmy back in Leila's arms and another clue in hand, return to the street
and cast Gateway to return to Ding Dong Dell.


Back to Ding Dong Dell
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Go back to the northeastern part of the first area of Ding Dong Dell to where
you got the enthusiasm from Tommy; talking to him will reveal that King Tom is
actually down in the well! He wants to go with you, but since Drippy refuses to
let him, he'll give you the familiar that was following him around instead! You
now have two familiars; the Mite and the Thumbelemur!

You'll get another lecture on familiar's abilities here, as your new one can
cancel enemy attacks. When you regain control, proceed north to the entrance of
the Ding Dong Well. Examine it for a quick tip from Drippy, then open your Spell
Menu and choose 'Spring Lock' to open the gate! Off to the well we go!


DING DONG WELL - WHERE A PUSSYCAT ONCE FELL... [WLK-1.5]
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
ITEMS: [ ] Iced Coffee, [ ] Poison-Be-Gone, [ ] Iced Coffee, [ ] Spiral Horn

PAGES: [ ] 62 (Frostbite)

ENEMIES: Rabbot, Taddlywink, Naja, Danglerfish, Bubbud, Hickory Dock (*)
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Head north a bit to fight a battle with a very short tutorial on switching
familiars. Afterward, take the eastern path at the fork here, turning north to
another branching path. Head east first - through the shallow water - opening
the chest at the dead-end here for a bottle of [ICED COFFEE]. Go back and
continue west, turning north at your next opportunity to come to another split.

Move west and north first to find another chest; get the [POISON-BE-GONE] out of
here, then return and head east, then north. Examine the large door here to open
it, where you'll find a large statue of King Tom with three unlit torches.
Approach each one and open your Spell Menu, then select Fireball. Do this
QUICKLY for each one, and the door to your north will open for you.

After going through it, you'll be at yet another fork. Run west, then north from
this one to another treasure-filled dead-end with another bottle of [ICED
COFFEE]. Make your way east now, and when the path turns south after you have
gone in the water, check behind the stairs and in the water to find a blue
chest. Use your Spring Lock spell on it to get a [SPIRAL HORN], which you should
immediately equip to your new Thumbelemur!

Keep moving east and you'll come to another unlit torch. DON'T light this one
just yet though; there are three to light like last time, but they're spread
around now. From this torch, head south and leap across the stones, then turn
east and light this torch with your Fireball spell. Now, QUICKLY head north,
lighting the one you come to here, then just as quickly jump down the stones to
your west to light the one we originally skipped. This is the shortest path; if
you were quick enough, the gate to your north will open. If not, then try it
again!

Proceed north down a long set of stairs, following the path as it turns west,
then north to come to another fork; take the northern path first, leading to a
dead-end with two chests. To the west is a [SANDWICH], and to the east is a
locked purple chest that we can't open just yet. Head back to the last fork and
continue east to one last intersection.

There's nothing we can do (yet) to the south, but you might want to take note of
the green chest there. In any case head north to arrive at a Waystone. Be sure
to recover and save, and when you're ready, proceed north to find King Tom,
along with a very interesting, beastly rodent!

 __________________________
| BOSS FIGHT: HICKORY DOCK |
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  STATS:   365 HP, Weak against: Fire, Resists: ---
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯
  ATTACKS: 1. Physical Attack [Single Target, Minor Damage]
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ 2. Mousefire [Single Target, Medium Damage, Use Defend!]
           3. Tailspin [Single Target, Confusion Effect, Switch to Thumbelemur!]

  REWARDS: 125 EXP, 100 G
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Start off the battle as Oliver, throwing Fireballs at the rodent while keeping
your distance until you get a feel for his moves. As long as you're on the move,
his physical attacks won't even touch you. Once you think you know his moves
well enough, switch to your Thumbelemur and go on an all-out physical assault
against Hickory.

His Mousefire attack is pretty quick and strong at the same time, so if you are
quick enough, try to Defend against it; otherwise, just grin and bear it, using
Healing Touch as necessary. However, sometimes his spell won't work, and it'll
actually blow back in the giant mouse's face, giving you a free shot! Dash in
there with your Thumbelemur and let loose a good chain of attacks.

His third move, Tailspin, can cause confusion to your familiars, but as Drippy
will tell you, your Thumbelemur isn't easily confused, so as soon as you see it
coming, be sure to switch to him to avoid getting nailed with that nasty effect.

As long as you occasionally switch to Oliver to heal up your HP and cast the
occasional Fireball to give your Thumbelemur some rest, your new familiar should
be able to take on the giant rodent practically on his own.

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

After the battle, you'll have to watch another set of scenes before you're
back in the palace, where you'll finally receive the [MAGIC WAND] from the King,
as well as the [FROSTBITE] spell. Sweet! Before continuing on with the
journey, we have some new Errands and Bounties!

DING DONG DELL - MORE BOUNTIES AND ERRANDS [WLK-1.6]
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

| To begin this errand, you must first find this mysterious forest. Take a     |
| look at your map; directly to the east of Ding Dong Dell is a path between   |
| two mountain ranges, with a forest right in the middle of that path. Just to |
| the north of THAT forest is the one we need to visit, so head east to the    |
| smaller forest, then north of it to arrive inside.                           |

| Once you're in the forest, approach the blue chest to the northwest and use  |
| your 'Spring Lock' spell to obtain a [BATTLER'S BADGE] accessory. Feel free  |
| to equip it, then talk to the boy beside the chest. He'll tell you that five |
| Rhinobores are destroying their homes, so you'll be the one to slay the      |
| beasts.                                                                      |

| Back out on the World Map, you'll see all five of them surrounding various   |
| parts of the forest. They are actually pretty easy; just go into battle and  |
| let your Thumbelemur have a sparring session with each one to quickly knock  |
| them out.                                                                    |

| Once they're down, return to the forest and talk to the boy again to receive |
| your reward: [ICED COFFEE x3} and [50 G]!                                    |

| gang up on you. Once you have those annoyances out of the way, let your      |
| familiar ravage the last of the fowls until he falls.                        |
|______________________________________________________________________________|


There's something else to do before departing. Depending on whom you received
your Enthusiasm from, one more person should be left with some of it. Check both
south and north Ding Dong Dell for a glowing green dot and talk to that person
to get a bit of Enthusiasm for the road (with the 'Take Heart' spell, as you
know by now).

Before continuing on with the story, we also have one more chest that we can
open now that we couldn't earlier, and we need to tell Old Father Oak our
progress, so from the World Map, make your way to the far north and re-enter
The Deep Dark Wood.


THE DEEP DARK WOOD
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
ITEMS: [ ] Milk Chocolate x5, [ ] Creamy Flan

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

First off, go ahead and make your way all the way north to Old Father Oak, who
will give you [MILK CHOCOLATE x5] to reward your growing familiars.

Now is an excellent time to give your familiars some treats. The Milk Chocolate
bars will increase their attack, and by now you should have plenty of other
treats for both Mite and Thumbelemur. You don't have to spend all your treats
at once (and probably can't anyway), but it's worth your while to at least give
them some of it.

Head back to the fork and go northeast, following the path for a long while
until you come to the fork just after jumping over the rocks in the stream. To
your southwest is that blue chest that we had to skip earlier, so make your way
up to it now and choose 'Spring Lock' from your Spell Menu to open it and obtain
a [CREAMY FLAN].

That's all you can do here right now, so let's get back to the story. Make your
way back to the entrance and head out to the World Map. Our destination is the
Golden Grove to the far southwest of the map, so make the long trek there.


GOLDEN GROVE - FOREST OF PLENTY [WLK-1.7]
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

¯¯¯¯¯¯ [ ] Hoarfrost Harpoon

PAGES: [ ] 36 (Quicken Growth), [ ] 174 (Gladiataur),

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

After a short scene, use the Waystone if you like, then make your way south.
There's a chest to the west at the fork, so be sure to open it for a [SANDWICH].
Follow the path east around the curve and keep heading east until you reach
several mushrooms that serve as stepping stones. Drippy gives you the go ahead
to just jump on them, so hop across them to the north to land at a fork. To the
north and west is an accessory that boosts attack, so be sure to head over there
and get the [BEAST FANGS] out of the chest. (Make note of the robot while you're
here.)

Head back to the fork and continue east, following the path as it turns south.
The mushrooms to your east only lead to a dead end, so head past them and you'll
eventually come to a rather large four-way fork. First off, take the eastern
path and follow it to a dead-end to get another [SANDWICH] against a tree, then
return and take the southern path for an [ICED COFFEE] at the dead-end there.

Just to the west is another fork; north leads to a dead-end, so head west first,
turning north at the clearing to find a blue chest. Use your 'Spring Lock' spell
on it, and you'll receive a [HOARFROST HARPOON]! Don't have any use for it yet,
but it'll be of use soon!

Continue further south and west to a dead-end... However, if you take a look at
the tree here, you'll find a familiar egg! After a bit of an explanation about
the eggs and life force, open your Spell Menu and cast 'Rejuvenate' on the
withered tree to restore it to its former glory. Watch the events unfold, then
you'll regain control.

Head back east and return to the last fork, where you'll see your yellow star to
the east; go check it out, and the little Seed Sprite from before will reappear,
so follow him as he leads you back north to the mushrooms that we passed
earlier. Talk to it again in this area to receive the [QUICKEN GROWTH] spell,
and the little guy will finally join your party!

With the new Seed Sprite, you can now Evade attacks, and you'll also be given a
lesson on counterattacking. Make sure to equip the newly found Hoarfrost Harpoon
on the Seed Sprite. That should be it here here in the forest for now, so go
ahead and make your way back to the last fork and make your way south. You'll
come to some small mushrooms that you can't climb, but with that new spell, you
can make them big enough to climb! Open your Spell Menu and choose 'Quicken
Growth' and you'll be able to climb them.

Keep following along, and as the path turns east, you'll come to another
Waystone (as well as a purple chest that can't be opened yet,) so be sure to
recover and save! When you're ready, proceed east to the open area, where you'll
find a fountain, but more importantly, a rather ticked off guardian!

Much like the battle with the Guardian of the Woods, you're going to want to
have your familiars sit this one out and let Oliver do most of the work, as this
guy hits HARD. That, and it's really tricky to get physical attacks in on this
guy while avoiding taking damage. For Oliver, Frostbite will be your best bet,
as it does more damage per MP than your Fireball would.

Both the Gladiataur's physical attacks and his Savage Swipe are really easy to
avoid; stay on the move and keep your distance. The Savage Swipe basically gets
thrown at you from the end of his sword, so just stepping to the left or right
will cause it to miss. Be careful, however; if it does hit, say goodbye to at
least 1/3 of your HP.

His last attack with his sword is the only one that's potentially worrisome;
Everblade. No matter where you are on the field, you'll still get hit by it
for quite a large amount of damage, so be sure to Defend against this attack.

As the battle endures, make sure you keep your HP and MP up, ESPECIALLY your HP.
Certainly don't let it fall below 50, or it might cost you. If you get low on
health, swap out your Seed Sprite and use Drowsy Drops to send Gladiataur to
dreamland. Be sure to swap back to Oliver at this point to heal yourself up.

After dropping about half of his HP, Gladiataur loses his mind and throws his
sword and shield away. He may seem upset, but now he's really easy to manage
because he no longer uses anything except physical attacks. From here, just keep
casting Frostbite.

However, once you've gotten Gladiataur down to 30% of his HP, he gets REALLY
ticked! He will now use his Headlong Rush attack, which is even stronger than
his Everblade. He'll only use it the one time, then Drippy will grab his shield
and knock him silly with it, giving you a chance to get some attacks in. Quickly
switch to Thumbelemur and rush him in there to get some melee attacks in before
he regains his composure. It might just be enough to finish him off.
Alternatively, look for a golden glim to perform a finishing move.

If that doesn't work, quickly switch to Oliver and fire off Frostbite spells as
fast as you can before he starts using his Rampage attack; it's the same as
Headlong Rush, but even stronger, it doesn't miss, and can easily take off half
of your HP. If you see it coming, use the Defend command immediately.

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

After the battle, you'll receive the [GLADIATAUR] page. Face the spring, then
open your Spell Menu and cast 'Rejuvenate' to bring the spring back to life. In
addition to it coming back, you'll receive the [THE EIGHTH TALE] of Wonder for
your Wizard's Companion.

Once you have those, head south to be back out onto the World Map, but this
time, in the Shimmering Sands!

As with the Rolling Hills area, we have quite a few treasures that we can grab
out here in the Shimmering Sands. However... it's going to be a bit of a
struggle to traverse this area to collect them all right now, as even Drippy
will tell you that the monsters here are a bit stronger than we're used to.

It's normally a good idea to do all optional things as soon as possible, but for
this area it's advisable and safest to wait with a grand exploration until
you're better prepared. There are nonetheless a few items that aren't too far
out of your way to Al Mamoon. Just make sure you're fully healed all the time,
and if possible avoid (or sneak up on) enemies.

 * Just to the northwest of the entrance to the Golden Grove are some twinkling
   stars up on a hill; examine these for a [GLOWCAP].

 • Travel even further west of the Golden Grove near the ocean; search the
   edge of the land that sticks out most into the water to find a [SPIRAL HORN].

 • Move southeast until you come to the entrance of the desert. From there, you
   should see a rocky valley split off to the northeast; go to the dead-end
   there and search the crevice on the far left side to find [GLOWCAP x2].

 * Further south of the entrance of the desert (and south of some quicksand) is
   another set of twinkling stars near a large stone and some cactii; examine
   them for a [BANEFLOWER].

 More exploration will follow later. For now, head to Al Mamoon in the center of
the desert.

Watch the scene as you enter, then you'll have to start your search for Rashad.
First, check near the entrance on the other side of the area on your right; you
should see a chest sitting near the "window" of sorts with [WHITE BREAD x3].
Further to the right, you'll see a twinkling urn; examine it for another loaf of
[WHITE BREAD].

Go inside the Cat's Cradle (the inn) while you're on this side of town and check
around inside. Just to the right of the purrprietor is another twinkling urn
with a [SALTED ICE CREAM], as well as a locked blue chest. Use 'Spring Lock' and
grab the cup of [STRONG COFFEE] out of it. While you're here, go ahead and spend
the 20 G to rest up (and recover all of your HP and MP). You'll receive another
page for your Wizard's companion: [THE SUMMERLANDS: SOUTH]! Head back out into
the town.

Head west to be back out in front of the Cawtermaster's Store. There aren't any
treasures inside of the store, but there's another twinkling urn just to the
left of the entrance and down the stairs that has [10 - 20 G] inside! Head down
the road here and visit the Hootique to your left. There's a chest just to the
right of the Hootenanny, so make sure to get the [SANDWICH] out of it before you
head back outside.

Go right *past* your destination first to collect a few more treasures. Against
the wall to the right of the your destination tucked away in the corner is
another twinkling urn, so grab the [BLINDNESS-BE-GONE] out of it, then make your
way north to a rather large town square.

Take a moment to stand at the entrance to the big area and look around; you
should see a chest very close to you to your west, an urn against the far
western wall;, another urn to the north of the fountain on your left, and one
last urn to the southeast of the fountain to your right (which you probably
can't actually see.) Start with the chest for [50 G], then make your way
clockwise from the western urn to get a [SOUR SUNDAE], a loaf of [WHITE BREAD],
and a [POISON-BE-GONE].

While you're in this area, make a note that Horace the Sage is by the fountain
to the right; use your 'Spirit Medium' spell to talk to him, and he'll give you
[THE FIRST TALE] of Wonder for your Wizard's Companion. Go ahead and read it
really quick by taking a look at it in your menu, then talk to Horace again to
have him give you a riddle. He'll ask you who the third smallest of the
characters were; the answer is 'DRAGON OF THE WEST', so type that all out to
receive the [DRAW POISON] spell from him.

There are some Errands and Bounties we can partake in, but for now, hold off on
them and continue the story just a bit further. Go to your destination and talk
to Rashaad to learn about his daughter. To proceed any further, you'll need to
return to Motorville and find her soul mate, so go ahead and cast 'Gateway' and
head back to your world!


To Motorville
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Head straight down to your destination to spot the girl, Myrtle, then make your
way to her house for a scene. Use the 'Spring Lock' spell on her door as Drippy
suggested... but it won't make any difference. Start making your way west, and
you'll run into Pea once again, so run back to Myrtle's house and talk to her.
She says that you need to go inside, so check the door again, and it'll be
unlocked!

Watch the scenes inside, then make your way to Rusty's shop to try to straighten
things out. Heed Drippy's warning before going in and make sure that your HP
and MP levels are decent. Also save while you're at it. When you're ready, head
inside. Rather than a calm meeting with Myrtle's father, you're treated to a
full on assault from a Nightmare!

Don't even bother using a familiar, as they practically don't stand much of a
chance. Control Oliver and spam your Frostbite attack, while collecting blue MP
glims as they appear on the battlefield.

Nightmare's physical attacks may seem somewhat harmless, but it's easy to get
caught in a flurry of them that will quickly drain your HP, so stay away from
him as much as possible. He's slightly faster than you are, but it matters not,
since his physical attack is initiated rather slowly. Foul Fumes is easy to
avoid as well, as long as you keep your distance; just make sure that you don't
step on the purple bubbles left over even after the spell is done, or you'll
still take damage and become poisoned.

Hard Heart, on the other hand, does a decent amount of damage once it lands, and
it will cause you to be Blinded, so be sure to quickly Defend once you see it
coming. As long as you're playing Oliver, being Blind won't make a bit of
difference, since you can still cast your spells with no problem.

Only when you run out of MP and with no blue glims available, use an Iced
Coffee, but only drink those precious cups sparingly.

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

After the battle you'll learn a bit more about Nightmares before deciding to
find a piece of heart to help; this time, we need some kindness. Luckily, it's
sitting right in front of you, so talk to his wife, then choose 'Take Heart',
followed by talking to Rusty and choosing 'Give Heart' and kindness to restore
him back to normal.

Head over to Myrtle's house once again to give her the good news. Watch the
heartwarming events inside the house, and you'll eventually regain control back
outside, ready to take some of Myrtle's newfound courage! Use 'Take Heart' to
get and store some courage in your Locket.

After you have that, go ahead and cast 'Gateway' to retrun to Al Mamoon.


Back to Al Mamoon
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Make your way back to Rashaad's stand and talk to his daughter, choosing 'Give
Heart' (courage) to return her back to normal as well! Some more scenes will
play, telling you about the Clarion among other things, and both Rashaad and his
daughter, Esther, will decide to help you in your fight. What makes it even
better is that Esther wants to help directly, and she will join your party as
your second full-time party member! Along with her will also come her very own
familiar, a Drongo! You'll also get [ESTHER'S CLOTHES] by default.

Of course, Rashaad will fulfill the need of what you originally came to him for:
spells. He'll give you the [PUPPET STRING], [SECRET INGREDIENT], [MAGIC LAMP],
and [PULSE] spell pages for your Magician's Companion! Sweet!

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
To continue on, we will now need to go through the Trials of the sages at the
Temple of Trials. Rashaad will accompany you to the Temple, and you will regain
control. Before we go, there is plenty to do, and we need to prepare ourselves
as well!

Start off by visiting the Cawtermaster's Store. You should have accumulated
quite a few Guilders by now for some shopping, so let's get some equipment.
Don't worry about getting a Bone Sword or Leather Shield for your Mite, nor a
Robe for Esther's Drongo; we'll be getting better equipment through Errands and
Bounties for those. For everyone/everything else though, go ahead and go all
out, upgrading them to the best available equipment right now. A Flint Spear is
a good investment for Esther's familiar, and the accessories give minor stat
boosts, although they're not quite necessary either.

Our next stop will keep us quite busy for a while; Swift Solutions. There is a
TON to do before moving on! Check the Errand Board to learn of the tasks there,
and talk to the Taskmaster to discover new Bounty Hunts.

NOTE: As you leave the city, you'll have another tutorial from Drippy on how
¯¯¯¯¯ to fight together with Esther. We recommend setting your AI to where
      both of your party members attack the same target. 
      
      While you're out here Bounty Hunting and running Errands, you may

| heart. Talk to him, and sure enough, he's got plenty of kindness to spare,   |
| so choose 'Take Heart' when it comes up to receive that extra bit of heart.  |

| To begin this errand, you need to talk to the woman who is just a bit south  |
| of the left milk fountain at the north end of town. Accept her task, and     |
| she'll give you the [LOVERS' LUNCH BASKET] to take to her husband, who       |
| happens to be in the Golden Grove. Go ahead and head back out to the World   |
| Map and make the trek to the far northwest to Golden Grove.                  |
|                                                                              |
| Of course, as chance would have it, the husband is quite a ways in the       |
| forest; look at your map and locate the blue dot to the northwest of your    |
| current position to see him. Drippy will warn you along the way that the     |
| monsters have taken a special liking to you since you have that yummy basket |
| of food, so keep your eyes peeled. Once you finally make it to the avid      |
| forager, he'll take the basket and leave you with a message to give to his   |
| wife.                                                                        |

| Make your way back out of the Grove and to Al Mamoon to his wife, who, after |
| hearing the lovely poem sent back for her, will reward you with [GLOWCAP x3] |

| ERRAND #046 - Bothersome Boneheads |
|¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯|
| DESCRIPTION: An elderly merchant from Al Mamoon is worried because her       |
| ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ supply lines are coming under attack.                           |

| To begin this errand, you need to talk to the merchant lady walking around   |
| just below the two milk fountains in the northern part of Al Mamoon. She's   |
| been having problems with Boneheads, so it's up to us to take care of the    |
| problem.                                                                     |

| Out on the World Map, you'll actually have to seek out and destroy 10        |
| Boneheads. They aren't pointed out to you in any way, so just start wandering|
| around and looking for them. Now would probably be a good time to do some    |
| treasure hunting, taking the bony buggers out as you come across them. (See  |
| the next section for locations.)                                             |
|                                                                              |
| Once you've defeated the tenth one, return to Al Mamoon and talk to the      |
| merchant lady again to receive your REWARD: a [BONE SWORD] and [200 G]!      |

| ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ required to make the famous tikka mahala curry.                 |

|                                                                              |
| NOTE: This errand cannot be fully complete until you've went to the Temple   |
| ¯¯¯¯¯ of Trials. However, it consists out of various other errands which you |
|       might want to do at this time anyway.                                  |
|                                                                              |
| To begin this errand, you need to talk to the guy manning the curry stall    |
| just to the right of the eastern milk fountain. He needs some ingredients    |
| for his ultimate dish, so you'll need to find them for him. Required are:    |
| Fluffy Rice, some Tender Beef, and a pinch of the Sheikh's special spices!   |
| Make sure to have some extra time allotted for this one, because it'll take  |
| a while (and it spans three actual tasks).                                   |
|                                                                              |
| First, stop at Rashaad's stand and talk to the woman just below it; she has  |
| some extra enthusiasm, so be sure to grab it with 'Take Heart'. [Or, if you  |
| had already gotten her enthusiasm for a previous errand, you'll have to      |
| backtrack to Ding Dong Dell for it.]                                         |
|                                                                              |
| Next, check your inventory; if you already have a Tender Beef and Fluffy     |
| Rice, then you're fine. If not, then stop in at the Hootique and buy one of  |
| each.                                                                        |
|                                                                              |
| Now head over to Swift Solutions, where a new blue dot has appeared on your  |
| map. This is the Sheikh you heard of, but he's brokenhearted and needs help. |
| Go ahead and accept Errand #003, then turn right around and hand over the    |
| enthusiasm with 'Give Heart' to return him to normal. As a thank you, you'll |
| receive [SANDWICH x2] and [100 G], effectively ending Errand #003.           |
|                                                                              |
| Now that he's back to normal, he will agree to give you some of his spices,  |
| but only if you bring him what he needs, which is a turmeric root and three  |
| generous pinches of spicy seeds. Off to find those as well!                  |
|                                                                              |
| Unfortunately, none of what he wants is actually in the city, so we need to  |
| find a way to get them. Stop in at Swift Solutions first and talk to the     |
| Taskmaster. A new Bounty Hunt has opened up, so go ahead and accept the job  |
| to start Bounty #088!                                                        |
|                                                                              |
| To get our turmeric root, we must defeat the lumberwood as shown in the      |
| Bounty, and he hangs out around Golden Grove, so leave the city and make     |
| your way northwest, taking on the beast once he's in your sight. The battle  |
| itself is a cinch; just cast Pulse with Oliver 2-3 times and he's toast!     |
| Upon his defeat, he'll relinquish the [TURMERIC ROOT] that you need, as well |
| as 62 EXP and 47 G.                                                          |
|                                                                              |
| Now, the last ingredient that you need is the spicy seed, and you need       |
| three of them. The only place to find them (and this is a one-time deal) is  |
| to the west-southwest of Al Mamoon in the Smoky Moutains. Climb the path     |
| toward the volcano, and along the way, you'll come across three sets         |
| twinkling stars as you get closer to the mountain itself. The first pinch    |
| of [SPICY SEEDS] will be at the corner where the path turns west; the        |
| second pinch of [SPICY SEEDS] will be to the west near the river of lava,    |
| and the third pinch of [SPICY SEEDS] will be all the way to the west near a  |
| stream of lava. To get the third one you'll need the Bridge spell, which     |
| you aqcuire at the Temple of Trials.                                         |
|                                                                              |
| Once you have those, return to Al Mamoon. Stop in at Swift Solutions first   |
| and claim your prize, [MILK CHOCOLATE x5] and [200G], ending Bounty #088.    |
| Afterwards, head back outside and talk to the Sheikh, giving him his         |
| ingredients. With them, he makes the spices you need, and you'll receive a   |
| bowl of [SHEIKH'S SPECIAL SPICES].                                           |
|                                                                              |
| Bring all ingredients back to Raj at the town square and he'll reward you    |
| with [TIKKA MAHALA x5] and [200 G] after a scene has played. You can now     |
| also buy Tikka Mahala at any time you wish from him for the price of 200 G.  |
| It's in fact an excellent healing item early in the game since it restores   |
| 150 HP.                                                                      |

When traveling through the valley leading towards the temple, a scene triggers
and you receive a new page of The Wizard's Companion, [THE SIXTH TALE] of
Wonder. Head up to the temple when you're ready.

There aren't any enemies for you to fight in this area, at least no regular
random critters. Instead you'll have to face three separate trials to test
your worthiness as a wizard's apprentice. Simply talk to Umbopa and Solomon to
watch some scenes first.

The Test of Wits
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Head right to start this trial, in which you must solve three puzzles. You'll
have to stand on the symbol and cast the 'Puppet String' spell in order to move
the statues around, although you might want to ask the bird for a hint first,
which is, "The dragon sees the warrior's sword, while the bird is shown his
shield, the beast, meanwhile, looks to his right, and sees an empty field."
Should you not be able to figure out the solution, the order in which the
statues must be placed is, from left to right: beast, dragon, warrior, bird.

                       VIDEO: http://tinyurl.com/b87rfzl

The second puzzle requires you to move the blocks, making them blend in the
overall picture. From left to right, the first block needs to be placed in the
center of the figure's 'mouth', the next block's proper location is the left-to-
center part of the right eye, the third block should be moved to the right part
of the mouth, the fourth block fits the left eye (its right side), and the last
block fits the left part of the face's mouth.

If you're still having trouble getting these where they go, or you lose track
along the way, hopefully these tables will help.

The third puzzle is a bit more complicated than the first. Your hint? "The bird
is bound to dragon and moon, and on a star he sits. The beast links warrior,
moon, and star, yet knows not where he fits." If you need help, it can be solved
as follows: Place the bird on the star mark on the lower right, the dragon on
the sun mark in the upper-right corner, the beast on the sun mark in the upper-
left corner, and the warrior on the moon mark directly to the right of the
beast. Completing this entire test nets you the [PROOF OF WITS].

The Test of Friendship
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
In these three trials, you have to control both Oliver and Esther simultaneously
to get them across the paths, without them falling off. As soon as you start,
the tiles will start falling down behind you, so a little speed is essential.
The first path is straightforward, but the second path requires you to stand on
switches to create bridges for the other person. The third path makes the two
paths cross from the left to the right and vice versa, so you might want to
control just one character at a time and quickly switch to the next. There are
no penalties for falling off, so you can try as often as you'd like. Finishing
this test grants you the [PROOF OF FRIENDSHIP].

The Test of Strength
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
The third and final test is a boss battle, as you might've expected. Talk to
Solomon when you're ready to initiate it.

 _____________________
| BOSS FIGHT: BASHURA |
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  STATS:   870 HP, Weak against: Water, Resists: Fire
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯
  ATTACKS: 1. Physical Attack [Single Target, Minor Damage]
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ 2. Devastation [All Allies, Medium Damage]
           3. Mind Over Matter [Range, Minor Damage]

  REWARDS: 435 EXP, 360 G, Spirit of the Temple
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
It's important to know that Bashura is programmed in such a way to only focus on
the character that you're *not* controlling. This allows you to get a familiar
to his side - not his back, which has magnificent defense thanks to the gigantic
shield - and pummel him. Thumbelemur and Mite are both good options, and a
flurry of attacks will often cancel Bashura's attacks, allowing you to pull off
an even longer assault.

None of his attacks are really worth even worrying about, as the most damage he
will do in one hit is ~30. If one of your characters gets in trouble, switch
over to them and move them out of the way. You could also heal them from a
distance; both options work well.

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

After the battle, you receive the page of [BASHURA] and the [PROOF OF STRENGTH].
Sage Solomon also rewards you with the [BRIDGE] and [BROOM BROOM] spells, as
well as the important [HEART-WINNING HARP].

Now that you have this harp, Esther can play serenades to seduce creatures into
becoming your familiar. You're given a tutorial on this in which you'll have to
select one out of three potential familiars: Shonky-Honker, Boggly-Boo, or a
Naiad. The Shonky-Honker is an all round familiar and fairly weak early in the
game, but has the potential to grow out to be the strongest familiar in the game
in terms of the magical attack stat. Boggly-Boo is a strong attacker which will
learn elemental attacks, and the Naiad is a familiar that is best used for
healing. If you plan on mastering Ni no Kuni, the Shonky-Honker might be a wise
decision. You can, however, catch these familiars later too.

Start the battle and fight the familiar of your choice, then play the serenade
as it falls in love with you. In regular battles there's only a small chance
that a creature does this, so you'll have to keep an eye out for when it does.

You'll also be shown how familiar metamorphosis works; this means your Mite is
undergoing a required metamorphosis. You'll be given a [SUNDROP] treat; give it
to Mite and he'll change into Mighty Mite. Unfortunately, this resets his level
back to 1, meaning he won't be as strong (in the beginning) as your Mite. On
the plus side, a level 1 familiar is leveled up very quickly and the first ten
levels should be a breeze to get.

Then there's the Familiar Retreat, which allows you to store any unneeded
familiars away (up to a total of 400). The first time you use it you'll receive
vials of [GREAT SAGE'S SECRET x3], basically an Elixir-like item that fully
restores the HP and MP of one character. You also receive [JUMBO SUNDROPS x3],
[JUMBO STARDROPS x3], [JUMBO MOONDROPS x3] and [JUMBO PLANETDROPS x3]. These are
all used to metamorphose your familiars (into their third forms). For now you'll
want to hold on to your familiars, but the retreat will prove very valuable
later in the game.

NOTE: You never have to worry about having too many familiars with you. If you
¯¯¯¯¯ catch a familiar when all your slots are full, it's automatically sent to
      the Familiar Retreat.

TIP: The Great Sage's Secret item is quite useful in (boss) battles, but before
¯¯¯¯ using any such Elixir, it's important to know that they can be sold for the
     massive amount of 6000 G. Especially early in the game, it's highly
     profitable to sell at least one of these (and possibly more) to solve all
     your financial problems for a long time to come. Great Sage's Secret is not
     unique and can be gotten later in the game, although they do remain fairly
     rare. And in case you were wondering, no, they're not used in any Alchemy
     formula (Alchemy is something you'll get soon enough), so the only reason
     you could have for keeping them around would be to use them in a battle to
     restore *one* ally's HP and MP for the price of 6000 G (in our opinion,
     hardly worth the price).


AL MAMOON - ADDITIONAL EXPLORATION [WLK-2.5]
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
You'll now have the opportunity to do several things. You can complete two more
errands, and there are various treasures on the world map waiting to be found.

NOTE: Now is also your last chance to backtrack and tell Old Father Oak about
¯¯¯¯¯ your adventure so far.  It's a rather long road to backtrack, and (this
      time) the only reward is some unique dialogue, so you might just want to
      read it below. Old Father Oak usually gives items, just not this time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Old Father Oak: "Ho ho ho! A new companion, hm? How very exciting!"
Oliver: "Uh-huh! Her name is Esther! She's awful clever, and-"
Drippy: "Oh, I see! She's CLEVER, is she!? Not like old Drippy, then? Silly old
         Drippy - always getting things wrong! And after all I've done!
         Ungrateful so-and-so..."
Oliver: "N-No, Mr. Drippy! I didn't mean that, I was just-"
Drippy: "Save youer breath, mun! Written all over youer innocent little face, it
         is! Youer lucky I'm not a sensitive soul! I'll just have to hope
         there's someone out there who'll appreciate a sidekick as lovable and
         funny and reliable as little old me..."
Old Father Oak: "Now, now, children! This is no time to let the green-eyed
                 monster get the better of us!"
Drippy: "Oh, and now I'm a monster, is it? Kick me while I'm down, why don't
         you?"
Oliver: "No, Mr. Drippy! You've got it all wrong! Gee, I don't know what I'd do
         without you! Please, you can't leave me! I need you!"
Drippy: "Well, er...since you put it like that, I s'pose I could stick around
         a bit longer, like..."
Old Father Oak: "Ho ho ho! You are as susceptible to flattery as you are to
                 jealousy, I see, Drippy! How very like you! Ho ho ho!"
Drippy: "What are you on about, mun? That wasn't flattery, that was the truth,
         plain and simple!"
Old Father Oak: "Very well, have it your way. I am just glad to see that you are
                 friends again. Now, on your way, and no more bickering!"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In any case, head back to Al Mamoon and while on your way you'll be told to
head to Old Smoky, the volcano in the far southwest. You might want to return to
Al Mamoon first to do another errand, though. You can also complete Errand #048.

WORLD MAP EXPLORATION - SHIMMERING SANDS EAST, SOUTHEAST & OLD SMOKY PATH
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
ITEMS: [ ] Carrot Cake, [ ] Shadowglass, [ ] Shinbone Shield,
¯¯¯¯¯¯ [ ] Hallowed Habit Robe, [ ] Burning Blade

*ITEMS: [ ] Glowcap, [ ] Baneflower, [ ] Shadowglass

ENEMIES: Tu-Whit, Turburn, Shonky-Honker, Floret, Turbandit, Small Fry,
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ Green Buncher, Sunshine, Lightshade, Boggly-Boo, Bonehead
________________________________________________________________________________

In case you haven't done so by yourself already, there are several more
treasures for you to find in the Shimmering Sands. The previous world map
exploration (of this area) yielded five treasures in the northwest and west
regions of the area. We'll now be exploring the rest (as far as possible).

• To the far south of the rock you are at now is a set of two large rocks; a
   larger one on the left, and a smaller one on the right. Make your way to that
   small rock on the right, and you'll find [100 G] if you examine the right
   side of it.



   East/Northeast region
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
 * On the right side of Al Mamoon's oasis are twinkling stars, indicating a
   forage point that contains, unsurprisingly, [SPRINGWATER].

 • Slightly southeast of Al Mamoon lies a large rock with some plants nearby.
   Search the place around the plants to find [CARROT CAKE x2].

 * To the east of Al Mamoon, and slightly northwest of the large rock as
   indicated on your world map (although there are several rocks that are not
   displayed on the map) you can find some twinkling stars that net a [GLOWCAP].

 • In the far northeast corner of the desert, search the area near the plants
   against the most northern rock to find [SHADOWGLASS x2].

   Southeast region
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
   WARNING: The creatures in this area are much tougher than the ones in the
            northern regions, so you'll want to be at least Level 15+. It's
            certainly possible to evade creatures, but do save your game before
            trying this. You can also wait with exploring this area until later.

 • The rock plateaus on the southeast can be accessed from their northeastern
   side. On the tip of the southernmost plateau (which is just one level down
   after climbing up to the highest plateau), look for a [SHINBONE SHIELD].

 • These plateaus also give access to a more grassy ledge. The southernmost tip
   has a hidden [HALLOWED HABIT ROBE] for you to dig up.

 * The rocky plateau that branches off to the southwest from the grassy ledge
   contains a forage point; the twinkling stars should be easily spotted. It
   contains a piece of [SHADOWGLASS].

   Old Smoky path
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
 • On your way to Old Smoky, keep your eyes open for the first crack of lava
   and inspect it at its largest flowing point to find a [BURNING BLADE].

 * Further down the path to Old Smoky, to the far west of the path - requiring
   you to cast the 'Bridge' spell you can find a twinkling forage point between
   some trees.  Here you'll find a [BANEFLOWER].

 • Just to the northeast of Old Smoky's entrance, inspect the far end of the
   path to find a [PHOENIX FEATHER] near the lava stream.


OLD SMOKY - THE MOLTEN MOUNTAIN [WLK-2.6]
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
ITEMS: [ ] Moondrop, [ ] Phoenix Feather, [ ] Sandwich, [ ] Flame Robes,
¯¯¯¯¯¯ [ ] Burning Blade, [ ] Strong Coffee, [ ] Cloud Cover

PAGES: [ ] 215 (Moltaan)
¯¯¯¯¯¯

ENEMIES: Deep Fry, Boggly-Boo, Little Bighorn, Shrimpaler, Ruffian,
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ Hullaballoon, Moltaan (*)
________________________________________________________________________________

Follow the path until you reach an intersection. The northern path leads to a
dead-end with a broken-down robot, so head east to reach another split. The
southeastern path leads to a sealed purple chest, where the path ends, so go
up the northeastern path and collect the [MOONDROP] from the chest as you
travel on.

TIP: The enemies in this area frequently leave various kinds of 'drops'
¯¯¯¯ behind: Sundrop, etc. These items will come in handy sooner or later when
     you want to metamorphose some of your familiars, so be sure to stock up
     on a few.

At the next intersection, definitely head left/west first to reach a dead end
with two regular chests containing a [PHOENIX FEATHER] and [SANDWITCH], along
with a sealed blue chest that contains a [FLAME ROBES] upon opening it with
'Spring Lock'.

Keep following the path and you'll notice that it really looks like it's about
to erupt. Continue until you reach an intersection; the right/northeastern path
leads to a chest with a [BURNING BLADE] inside. Follow the other path up the
mountain until you reach a Waystone - heal up and save.

The left path at the next intersection leads to an inaccessible green chest, so
head right and cast your Frostbite spell to continue over the stream of lava.

Drippy then tells you that there are only three minutes left to stop the volcano
from erupting, so get moving! [It will indeed be game over if the timer reaches
zero, so get a move on. It's also good to know that the timer stops during
battles. You'll still want to hurry up if you wish to get the treasures; you
only have roughly 10 seconds to spare. You can also skip the treasures and head
for the goal, then backtrack (since the timer will be gone).] Make your way
northeast, scaling along the edge while avoiding the steam coming out of the
wall; those won't do any damage, but they will cost you time. Once you're on the
other side, keep going along the path until you see path shoot off a bit to the
west. Open the chest at the dead- end here for a cup of [STRONG COFFEE].

Head back to the main path and continue north and west, following along the
long, spiraling path until you come to another lava stream; use your Frostbite
spell to pass it. A little further on you'll reach a fork splitting northeast
and southwest; quickly take the northeastern path first to come to a dead-end
containing a [CLOUD CLOVER] cloak.

Head back to the fork and continue southwest, and you'll eventually come to
another thin ledge that you have to scale. Cross it, then once you've made it to
the other side and to the yellow star, you'll find out nothing happens after
all. Figures! Feel free to relax a bit now, since the timer is gone, and get
your party situated if you need. Recover your HP and MP and save at the
Waystone.

TIP: Now's also a good time to equip the Cloud Clover on Thumbelemur, as it'll
¯¯¯¯ make him faster and gives him better defense. Definitely equip your Flame
     Robes on your Drongo (and Seed Sprite, if you brought it). Any other good
     equipment you haven't yet given your familiars should now be put to use
     as well.

Continue northeast to the crater, where Shadar will summon a giant lava beast
for you to take on!

You'll want to stay as Oliver in this battle, spamming your Frostbite spell
against Moltaan. Stay to the far edge of the field while firing off that spell,
and don't worry too much about your HP; Esther should keep your HP up. If your
HP does manage to fall below 50, then take a moment to either use an item or
cast Healing Touch to keep you going.

The only attack that does major damage is his physical attack when decides to go
on a rampage on one ally. Other than that, all of his attacks will do well under
40 damage each time, leaving you plenty of time to attack before you have to
worry about healing. Honestly, none of them are even worth defending, so focus
on blasting him with your ice.

As you go on with the battle, Drippy will let you know that its tail is the weak
spot, so try to stay behind him while blasting him with Frostbite. Fire away and
watch your MP, using a Strong Coffee as needed to keep it from reaching a point
where you can't cast spells.

After you've finally done enough damage, the beast will stumble back into the
lava, and Oliver will knock the massive rock into the lava on top of him,
effectively ending the battle.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

After the battle, you'll receive the page for [MOLTAAN]. A portal will also open
up afterward, allowing instant teleportation to the foot of the mountain. From
there, simply return to Al Mamoon by foot. After debriefing Rashaad, several
bounties and a new errand become available, which you might just want to check
out.


AL MAMOON - LOOSE ENDS [WLK-2.7]
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
ITEMS: [ ] Phoenix Feather x3
¯¯¯¯¯¯
________________________________________________________________________________

NOTE: Now that you've defeated Moltaan, you can report your progress to Old
¯¯¯¯¯ Father Oak and earn yourself [PHOENIX FEATHER x3]; however, since you
      might want to backtrack for several items soon enough, you'll want to
      save yourself the trouble of having to do this twice, so postpone this
      for a little while until the time is ripe.

Head over to Swift Solutions to find two new bounties available. A look at the
errands board reveals that one new errand can now be done as well.

| ERRAND #080 - Notes from a Volcano |
|¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯|
| DESCRIPTION: A man visiting Al Mamoon is rather flustered after misplacing   |
| ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ his diary again.                                                |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| GOAL: Agree to look for the missing diary.                                   |

|                                                                              |
| Speak with the rich man located to your immediate left as you enter the      |
| town square of Al Mamoon, and you should recognize him as the traveler from  |
| Ding Dong Dell. Looks like he lost his diary again, so off you go.           |
|                                                                              |
| This time the diary can be found on the trail leading to Old Smoky. It's not |
| too far away actually. Once you pass the first large crack in the ground     |
| (on the left side), inspect the big tree just behind it to find the actual   |
| [TRAVELER'S DIARY]; this is slightly southeast of the first lava stream (in  |
| which you have found a Burning Blade before). Return to the man to claim     |
| your reward.                                                                 |

| BOUNTY #091 - Merchants' Menace |
|¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯|
| DESCRIPTION: A monster has been attacking traveling merchants and stealing   |
| ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ their wares. It must be dealt with as soon as possible!         |

| This bounty is located to the far south, in the grassy area near Castaway    |
| Cove. More specifically, you'll need to create a bridge (with the 'Bridge'   |
| spell) to travel to the east part of the area, where it resides on a hill to |
| the south.                                                                   |
|                                                                              |
| The Gobspeed is accompanied by two lesser Hog-Goblins, making this a rather  |
| tough fight for this point in the game. You'll want to be around level 20,   |
| and you might also want to give your familiar your current best equipment,   |
| such as the Burning Blade (among other things).                              |
|                                                                              |
| Your first priority should be to take out one of the Hog-Goblins, but don't  |
| lose track of Oliver or Esthers' health; as soon as they fall below 50% of   |
| their HP, quickly cast a healing spell or give them a proper health boost    |
| by way of items. When the first Hob-Goblin is eliminated, heal your party    |
| and go for the second one. With just the Gobspeed left, the remainder of the |
| battle should be much easier to handle.                                      |
|                                                                              |
| If you're having trouble and taking too much damage with just your familars, |
| then try fighting as Oliver and continuously cast Pule to knock them away as |
| they're about to carry out their attacks, and it should minimize the damage. |

| For some reason, now we can never listen to the Muse song 'Madness' without  |
| hearing this quests' name. Hopefully it's the same for you now, so that we   |

| Magmoiselle can be found at Old Smoky; head north at the first intersection  |
| to find her at the dead end with the broken robot. She's a unique creature   |
| that can only be fought during this bounty.                                  |
|                                                                              |
| This battle isn't too hard if you give Esther her Drongo while you stay in   |
| control of Oliver himself and keep casting Frostbite. Magmoiselle will       |
| usually keep chasing after you, and althrough her physical attacks are quite |
| powerful, keeping a distance isn't that hard. She also has a more powerful   |
| fire-based long range attack; defending against it works best.               |
|______________________________________________________________________________|


By now you should have a few merit cards left to exchange for powerups. It's
up to you to decide, although Jack-in-the-Box (if you don't already have it)
may prove useful in dungeons and parts of the world map with more powerful
adversaries.

________________________________________________________________________________


 * There's a small pool of water just west of the entrance to the Castaway Cove
   area (where the grassy fields begin). Search the twinkling forage point to
   find a [WETSTONE].

 * To the far (north)west of the area is a ramp leading up to the rocky
   platforms. It's a bit of a walk, but you can find a twinkling forage point
   on the far north-middle side; it contains a piece of [SHADOWGLASS].

 • Head to the far (south)west of these plains, then continue over the platforms
   to the east. At the very end of this path, after you have gone east, then
   turn south and back to the west, where the cliff of the sea intersects with a
   higher platform, search the ground for a [STURDY SHINBONE].

 * Return to the grassy fields of Castaway Cove. On the far southwest platform
   adjacent to the sea and near the mountains you should be able to spot this
   twinkling forage point containing [RINGS-A-BELL].

 • The adjacent platform immediately below (with a bunch of trees) contains a
   [STRONG COFFEE]. Search the middle of the ridge closest to the sea.

 * Head to the far east side of the Castaway Cove area; this requires you to
   build a bridge (with the 'Bridge' spell) if you hadn't already do so. The
   twinkling forage point in the middle of the upper platform contains a bundle
   of [SLUMBERNOT LEAVES].

 • In the same area, head to the far south(east) of the area, traveling through
   the forest zone until you reach a small beach to the far south. Search the
   soil to find [SALTED ICE CREAM x2].

Castaway Cove can be found somewhere in the middle of the far south coastline.
If you have trouble finding it, use your map for guidance.

As soon as you enter, a cutscene plays; you're now supposed to chase the thief
who stole the cauldron from a merchant. If your characters aren't fully healed,
visit the Cat's Cradle (inn) first, because a boss fight is coming up. This also
grants you [THE LOST CONTINENT] page, and while you're here you might as well
grab an [ICED COFFEE] and a bar of [MILK CHOCOLATE] from the pot and chest
respectively (but not respectfully).

Head to the far east side of town and take the lower path to visit the docks.
The thief is located at the last one; approach him and a scene will play,
leaving you with the [PECULIAR POT]. Of course, poor Drippy's the one to have to
lug it on his back...

Return to the owner, who doesn't seem to happy about all of this, then look at
page 74 of your Wizard's Companion to find the keycode that unlocks the
cauldron: Open Says-A-Me. (Open Sesame, get the pun?) This triggers a scene and
a boss battle.

 ______________________
| BOSS FIGHT: AL-KHEMI |
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  STATS:   1520 HP, Weak against: ---, Resists: Water
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯
  ATTACKS: 1. Physical Attack [Single Target, Minor to Medium Damage]
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ 2. Al-Khombo [Flurry of attacks, Major Damage, Use Defend!]
           3. Alakaz...Um... (Burning Sword) [Greatly increases his strength]
           4. Alakaz...Um... (Parasol) [Greatly reduces his strength]
           5. Hubble-Bubble [10 Second Countdown, Major Damage to all allies,
                             Use Defend!]

  REWARDS: 777 EXP, 620 G
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
The fight against Al-Khemi is both funny and tough. Since his normal attacks
contantly interrupt any physical attacks directed toward him, start your battle
using Oliver and cast Pulse repeatedly, only breaking to heal either himself or
Esther.

The fight against Al-Khemi is both funny and tough. His regular physical attacks
deal some damage, but aren't anything to worry about. His Al-Khombo attack,
however, is very powerful and hits multiple times. Whoever Al-Khemi is facing
will be the lucky target, so if he targets the character/familiar you're NOT
controlling, quickly switch to that character and defend. 

The Alakaz...Um.... attack comes in two varieties. If Al-Khemi pulls out his
burning sword, stay away, heal your party, and use long distance attacks such as
Pulse. On the other hand, if he pulls out his parasol, rush in with your
strongest familiar and whack him as much as you can.

When Al-Khemi gets low on health, down to roughly 20% of his HP, he'll dive
into his cauldron with the Hubble-Bubble attack. It has a countdown of 10
seconds, so heal your party members and defend when the counter reaches 3 to
minimize damage. Be sure to quickly heal up your other party member, then start
attacking Al-Khemi again to finish him off.

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

After defeating Al-Khemi you'll become his master; you get the [CAULDRON],
giving you access to Alchemy. Al-Khemi (get the pun?) also gives you a bottle
of [PIXIE DEW], a bunch of [SOUR GRAPES], and [SLUMBERNOT LEAVES x3]. You have
to combine these in the Alchemy tutorial, resulting in a [SPRITE DEW], a great
healing item that restores 200 HP to all party members. (You will also have
gotten the [SPRITE DEW FORMULA (006)], of course.)

There are a total of 134 recipes in the game, and many of them can be gotten
by talking to NPC's. You'll get more recipes in a few moments.

Head back to the docks where you found the thief and you'll trigger a scene in
which the Governor gives you three sets of [BATHING SUITS]. Feel free to explore
the town now.

First, stop by at the lady with the red turban standing on a small boat in the
westernmost pier. She gives you a ton of recipes: [SANDWICH FORMULA (003),
[FISHBURGER FORMULA (002)], [STRONG COFFEE FORMULA (007)], [CAPPUCCINO FORMULA
(008)], [MILK CHOCOLATE FORMULA (013)], [CREAMY FLAN FORMULA (018)], [CARROT
CAKE FORMULA (023)], [SOUR SUNDAE FORMULA (028)], [SWEETIE PIE FORMULA (033)] &
[SALTED ICE CREAM (038)].

Castaway Cove also houses various chests and pots. Return to the entrance as
we'll start exploring from that point. Head over the bridge to your left/
northeast to find a slice of [SWEETIE PIE] and [20 - 40 G] from the chest and
pot respectively. Head east and look for a glimmering pot just before the curve
which contains a [CAKE or CHOCOLATE or FLAN].

Head over the nearby bridge leading south and talk to Horace (who only appears
if you've spoken to, and completed his assignments before). After casting
'Spirit Medium' on him, he'll ask you to translate a piece of Nazcaän from your
Wizard's Companion. Look at page 13 and closely inspect the wizard's robe to
locate the symbols. You can translate these with the Nazcaän Alphabet (at the
bottom right on the overview page of the book) to find that it reads: 'Finest
Fiber'. Give the answer to Horace and he'll reward you with the [VACATE] spell,
which allows you to teleport out of dungeons; rather handy!

Now make your way over to the docks and look for a chest on the right side at
the bottom of the stairs to find a [SANDWICH]. There's also a blue chest on the
first pier to the north with a [FISHBURGER] inside.

Now's a good time to do a few errands, although there aren't all that many
available. Stop by Swift Solutions at the northwestern end of town and make sure
to activate all of 'em (why does the jerk Taskmaster get to stay fully clothed?)
then proceed to your destination on the map. Talk to the man here--Sindbah--who
sends you back to Al Mamoon to get permission from her royal highness Cowlipha
to ride the ship.

Return to Al Mamoon and attempt to enter the palace.. Access denied! Head over
to the Cat's Cradle (inn) and speak with the purrprietor to trigger a scene.
Afterward, cast the Gateway spell and travel back to Motorville.

Head over to Leila's shop, triggering a scene. Afterward it's back to Al
Mamoon, where you must inspect the left milk fountain on the town square and
cast the 'Secret Ingredient' spell to conjure a [GIANT CHEESE WEDGE] out of thin
air (and some milk, of course). You can now speak to Abull, who'll let you into
the castle. Unfortunately, the Cowlipha appears to be in need of some restraint,
which you must now go out and seek. (Quite a frightening scene, that was.)

Visit the Cawtermaster first, who tells you that Abull's the one you're looking
for. Don't forget to purchase a Flint Dagger here for errand 76 (unless you
already have one) now that you're here anyway. Return to the castle, take some
restraint from Abull and give it to her Moojesty! This returns things to ..
well, things are indeed a little different now. After the scenes you'll receive
a [LETTER OF PASSAGE], a [PORTRAIT], as well as the [NATURE'S TONGUE] and
[BURDEN] spells.

Before you leave town, talk to the boy near the entrance of town to do a new
errand (#047). It lets you make good use of your newly acquired spell.

Return to Castaway Cove to trigger a scene. Be sure to rest at the Cat's Cradle
if your party isn't funkyfresh at the moment, because we've got a boss battle
coming up! You might also want to stock up on Sleep-Be-Gones as well as some
Confusion-Be-Gones from the peddler. When you're all set, head for the pier to
face what looks to be another nightmare creature.

 ________________________________
| BOSS FIGHT: SWAINE'S NIGHTMARE |
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  STATS:   1280 HP, Weak against: Light, Resists: Dark
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯
  ATTACKS: 1. Physical Attack [Single Target, Minor to Medium Damage]
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ 2. Bad Dream [All Targets, Inflicts Sleep]
           3. Grudge [Single Target, Inflicts Curse]

  REWARDS: 860 EXP, 700 G
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
This Nightmare creature will frequently attempt to put your characters to sleep,
or otherwise curse them, significantly impairing their movement, allowing it
to hit you with quite a few nasty regular physical attacks.

Move in with a familiar right away and perform an all out attack. The sleep
ailment is annoying since Nightmare might inflict a critical hit on you, but
after any such hit you're good to go again; heal up and continue your sequence
of attacks. Also keep an eye on your second party member's health and don't let
it drop below 40-50%.

If you see Nightmare charging up for Bad Dream, it's quite possible to cancel
the attack with a series of attacks, and you should always attempt this if
you're high on HP. It might just generate a golden glim. If it does, the battle
is surely in it's last phase.

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

After the fight, find the restraint you're looking for by visiting the Cat's
Cradle, where you'll find the Governor, who's more than willing to share a
piece. Bring this back to the quayside and heal the thief, who's name turns out
to be Swaine. He and his Hurly familiar will join you, incidentally also
granting you the ability to open up green chests with his pickpocket's pistol.
Walk up to the green chest nearby and lock onto it to collect the [FLING FLAME
GEM] inside it!

Before you set sail, there are several things you can do in town first, and
there are also green chests in other locations that you had to skip earlier on.

   List of Green Chests 
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
 • Location: Castaway Cove. Head to the entrance of the town and cross the
   bridge to southeast. After crossing it, take a few minor steps to your right
   and turn around, facing south. You can spot the green chest across the water,
   lying on a pier. Use Swaine's Pistol to collect a [CARNATION CAKE] (a high
   level treat that increases magical attack).

 • Location: Old Smoky. Make your way to the (2nd) Waystone in the middle of
   the area and take the left path at the intersection just up ahead. The green
   chest can be found at the end; it contains [PIXIE DEW]. You can cast the
   Vacate spell to quickly teleport back to the world map.

 • Location: Al Mamoon. Head up to the town square and stop just before stepping
   onto the actual plaza. Walk to the right/east side of the street, position
   yourself between the palm tree and the man with a turban, then look up; this
   green chest is hidden away on the roof of the building on the west side and
   contains a [RUBY RIPPLE ICE CREAM] (another high level treat that increases
   evasion).
 
 • Location: Golden Grove. Entering the place from the Shimmering Sands, follow
   the path to the crossroads and head north. Use Quicken Growth on the
   mushrooms if you hadn't already and step up the fourth one; look to your left
   to spot the green chest, which contains a bar of [FAIRY CHOCOLATE] (another
   high level treat - this one increases attack). If you're traveling to the
   other side of the Golden Grove, don't cast Vacate; it'll drop you off at the
   side from which you entered.
 
 • Location: Ding Dong Dell. Head to the west part of town and walk to the most
   southern tip of the area, where you'll spot three vases against the town's
   wall. Look down next to the tree to spot the green chest; it contains a slice
   of [SEE-THROUGH PIE] (you've guessed it; this one boosts accuracy).
 
 • Location: Ding Dong Well. Head to the waypoint at the end of the area. From
   here, head all the way south to find the green chest behind bars to the east.
   It contains a [WATER BOMB GEM] (which teaches the Water Bomb Trick to a
   familiar). Either use the Vacate spell, or travel to the square beyond the
   waystone to find a warp circle that allows teleportation back to the entrance
   of the well.
 
Now's also an excellent time (as well as your last chance for this particular
story progression interval) to stop by Old Father Oak and tell him about your
progress. As way of thanks he gives you a nice [PHOENIX FEATHER x3].
 
There are also various errands you can now do in Castaway Cove.

| Use the 'Nature's Tongue' spell to talk to the crab on the second pier in    |
| the harbor, and he'll ask you to look for his missing crab friend.           |
|                                                                              |
| You'll have to set sail first in order to complete this errand. Once you do, |
| head over to the east side of Robinson's Island and look for the crab on the |
| far (north)east sandbank. Speak to him and return to the crab in Castaway    |
| Cove to deliver the message that he's doing well.                            |

It's smart to purchase the best equipment for your familiars at the peddler if
you hadn't already, however, some of the equipment gotten from Alchemy is better
and costs less to make. Should you be low on money, remember that you can always
sell some of your Great Sage's Secret for 6000 G.

There are several items and pieces of equipment that you can now create by
Alchemy. Below are the ones most useful at this point. Most items needed can
be bought from shops in Al Mamoon, others are found at forage points or dropped
by, and stolen from creatures:

Shadowglass Knife: Flint Dagger + Shadowglass
Knucklebone Claws: Crude Claws + Sturdy Shinbone
Toughened Armor:   Rugged Armor + Supple Leather
Stripy Cloak:      Snakeskin Cloak + Supple Leather
Poisoned Fang:     Giant's Tooth + Baneflower
Stalwart Scale:    Sturdy Shinbone + Wetstone

The following two can be gotten very shortly:

Scale Shield: Leather Shield + Sturdy Scale + Angula
Breezy Cloak: Sea Breeze Cloak + Angula x2

When you're all set, approach the ship to sail away!

         *Only the enemies you can handle at this point are listed above.
________________________________________________________________________________


You can now explore the worldmap, although many enemies are way too strong for
you to currently handle. There are, nonetheless, several areas you might want to
check out already before going straight to Autumnia.

 • Visit the previously inaccessible beach that is barely to the northwest of
   Castaway Cove and search the rock wall in the middle for a [POINTY HAT],
   which is an excellent piece of defensive equipment for Hurly, Swaine's
   familiar.

 * (South)east of Castaway Cove lies Robinson Island, a series of small isles.
   Disembark at the first small (westernmost) island to find a forage point
   that contains a [GNOMEBEARD].

 * A second forage point can be found on Robinson Island itself, in the middle
   of the western area, near some bush. It contains an [ANGULA], which is used
   in some useful alchemy formulas as seen above.

 • The far south tip of Robinson Island contains a [SACRED DAGGER], which is
   a pretty good weapon at this point in the game. It has a small chance (3%)
   to inflict Nix on enemies whenever it strikes.

 • For the last treasure on Robinson Island, you can find [FISHBURGER x2] at the
   base of the (north)easternmost palm tree.

   (The crab from errand #050 can also be found on the nearby sandbank.)

 • East from Robinson Island lies a small sandbank with a large shell on its
   south side. Inspect it to find a [FINE FROCK], which is an excellent piece
   of equipment for the time being.

 * To the northeast of Robinson Island (as well as the small sandbank) lies
   Friday Island. There's a forage point next to the lone palmtree that gives
   you [SLUMBERNOT LEAVES x2].

 • Head to the far north tip of Friday Island and inspect the palm trees to
   find [STURDY SHINBONE x2].

Now's also an excellent time to do the three bounties from Castaway Cove (#093,
#094 & #095).

| These catbandits can be found on the small island south of Robinson Island.  |
| Be sure to defeat the Purrloiner first, then heal your party and solely      |
| focus on the Cutpurrse, only going for the Puss in Bouts after its comrades  |
| have fallen. It helps to have water spells/tricks, but they're not really    |

| This creature can be found swimming around Robinson Island. Disembark the    |
| Sea Cow and check your local map to get an idea where it's current position  |
| is. It's wise to equip weapons that inflict the Storm element since the      |
| creature is weak against it. Abilities such as Thunderspark are particularly |
| effective in this battle, so be sure to command your Drongo manually and     |
| have a full MP bar at the start of the fight.                                |

| To the northeast of Castaway Cove is a piece lies a piece of unexplored land |
| of which one entrance is blocked by a big Collum. Defeating it is best done  |
| by keeping your distance (with the possible exception of Swaine's Hurly) and |
| casting Storm-elemental attacks with your Drongo. Equip other familiars such |
| as the Mite with Storm-based equipment to give you a small advantage.        |
|______________________________________________________________________________|


You can now head back and claim the bounties. If you have any full Merit Cards
left you can now purchase a new Merit Award; Jolly Jack-Tar. This allows your
ship to move faster, also making it easier to avoid any unwanted encounters with
enemies. If you've been doing all errands and bounties so far, it's the last
award currently available. If your party members are exhausted from all the
fights, head over to the Cat's Cradle as well to heal up.

NOTE: By completing all Bounty Hunts up until now, you should receive the 'New
¯¯¯¯¯ Sheriff in Town' trophy for completing 10 Bounties.

When you're ready, head back to your ship and set sail to Shipwreck Shore!


The Shipwreck Shore
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
WARNING: You're about to explore an area with very powerful enemies. Save your
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ game beforehand and keep multiple files so you can even save during
         your exploration without possibly getting stuck somewhere.

Head to the piece of unexplored land to the northeast of Castaway Cove (where
you fought the Collum), which is properly called 'Shipwreck Shore'. The enemies
here are BRUTAL, so it's best to save your game and try to avoid them while
searching for the following treasures. You have been WARNED. Remember that you
can also run from enemies; it's wise to do so around here.

 • Enter the area through the arch on the south. Directly left/west of the
   arch (on the northern side) you can find [CAPPUCCINO x2] next to the curved
   rock wand.

 • There's a hidden Forest Glade on the top of the eastern plateau next to the
   arch. To get here, travel along the west side to reach the top of the hill,
   then move east over the arch and enter the forest. There are many enemies
   around this area, so be sure to save your game beforehand. Inside the forest
   glade you can grab a [GAME PIE] from the regular chest, note down the
   existence of the purple chest, and stand next to the tree across these two
   chests, looking up to the pillar to the north to notice a green chest with a
   [SAGE'S SECRET] inside.

 * The forage point just south of the hidden Forest Glade contains a
   [GNOMEBEARD], but it's heavily guarded by enemies and might not be worth it
   at this point.

 • It's a little tricky to navigate towards it without getting into any fights,
   but the grassy ridge to the far southwest has [ANGULA x2].

 • Approach the ruins to the north. While the building is inaccessible, the
   pillar directly south (on the right) marks [SEE-THROUGH PIE x2].

 • Taking the arch near the beach as starting point, head all the way north to
   the second set of ruins near the mountains and inspect the big, partly buried
   rectangular stone to find [FISHBURGER x2].

 • Head back to your ship and disembark at the shipwreck just on the eastern
   side of the beach, to the south. Search between the rocks on the southwest
   side of it to find [DUMBFLOUNDER x5].

 • Disembark at the second shipwreck (just to the north of the first) and
   inspect the bottom side of its front to find [GLOWSHRIMP x5].

 * There's also a forage point up the mountain north of the second shipwreck
   that contains an [ANGULA], but the area is roaming with monsters, so it's
   best to harvest it later.

While you can technically explore other areas of the world map at this point,
doing so is very dangerous as the creatures will slaughter you with the blink
of an eye. It's better to sail to your destination, Hamelin.

NOTE: Now is also your last chance to backtrack all the way to Old Father Oak,
¯¯¯¯¯ telling him about your progress. Your reward will be [PIXIE DEW x3].


SAILING TO AUTUMNIA (AND TEEHEETI) [WLK-3.2]
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
ITEMS: [ ] Sprocket x2, [ ] Carnation Cake x2, Soretooth Ring,k [ ] Fishburger,

*ITEMS: [ ] Gnomebeard, [ ] Wetstone, [ ] Rings-a-Bell
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
PAGES: [ ] The Fifth Tale (278-283)
¯¯¯¯¯¯
ENEMIES: Shadar (373) (*), Sprog Cog (141), Wishing Whambat (086),
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ Stabber (030), Mohawk (082), Spike Tyke (114)
________________________________________________________________________________

When you get close to your destination, Shadar suddenly appears..

 ____________________
| BOSS FIGHT: SHADAR |
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  STATS:   2050 HP, Weak against: Light, Resists: Dark
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯
  ATTACKS: 1. Fell Wind [Range Attack, Medium Damage]
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ 2. Pyre [Single Target, Medium Damage]
           3. Bleak Midwinter [All Target, Major Damage, Use Defend!]

  REWARDS: ---
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
It's very important to know that you don't have to fully deplete Shadar's HP;
dropping it to 60% is enough. While it's extremely important that you keep your
characters healthy, it's on the other hand just as essential to quickly drain
Shadar's HP, even if you're starting to get low on health yourself. Using
Sandwiches is a good idea; these heal for much more than your healing spells.
Use the tactics command to tell Esther that she should heal the party while you
focus on attacking Shadar with Oliver and Swaine's familiars. If a series of
attacks from your side can prevent Shadar from casting some of his powerful
spells, all the better.

If things go less well - that's how it goes every once in a while - don't
hesitate to play more defensively, unless Shadar's health is really close to
dropping to 60%, in which case you should get those final few blows in to end
the battle. If Shadar charges up for his Bleak Midwinter attack, definitely
try to defend against it, quickly healing up with Sandwiches afterward.

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

You'll find yourself washed ashore Teeheeti Island afterward. You'll now have
access to the All-Out Defense and Attack commands with square and triangle
respectively. You'll also unlock [THE FIFTH TALE] of Wonder for your Wizard's
Companion. Let's search the island for a few treasures now, shall we?

TIP: Now's also a good time to steal an Emberstone from the Mohawk birds on this
¯¯¯¯ island. You need this for errand #076. In fact, it's generally a good idea
     to steal items with Swaine every now and then. Many items will be of use
     eventually in a formula or sidequest.

 • Head east and follow the beach to the north side, cross the creek and inspect
   the cliffs at the far end (at the spot where they intersect with the beach
   and the sea) to find [SPROCKET x2].

 * There's a forage point just northwest of the beach you start at, right
   before the forest starts. It contains a [GNOMEBEARD].

 • Head to the southernmost part of the beach and search the northern tip of
   the sandbank lying between two creeks to find [CARNATION CAKE x2].

 * There's a forage point to the northwest; it's located at the spot where the
   two creeks merge and it contains a [WETSTONE].

 * On the western beach of the island is an arch with a forage point that
   contains a [RINGS-A-BELL]. You'll have to go under the arch to the north,
   then up a hill to the east to get on that level.

 • Search at the base of the pillar (in the water on the western side) that
   supports the arch to find a [SORETOOTH RING].

 • If you follow the western beach to the north, you'll reach a cave, hidden by
   a waterfall running over it. Inside are many crabs that give gameplay tips,
   but there's also a chest with a [FISHBURGER] inside, and a hidden green chest
   on the far west side; position yourself next to the pillar, near the moss-
   covered rocks and look north to collect its [WATER BOMB GEM].

 • Approaching the town in the middle of the island, first travel slightly
   east/northeast from the center and search the grassy part without trees
   (nearby the river) to find a [DRYAD'S SPEAR], an excellent weapon that
   drains 10% of the enemy's healh with every hit.

When you're done talking to crustaceans and collecting treasures, return to your
ship, then proceed directly northwest and into the forest to find out what
Drippy was so worried about. You'll then find out your next destination, so
continue just a bit more north to enter the Fairyground!

Fairies! Fairies everywhere! A group of them will grab Drippy and run off with
him, so let's plod along so we can get him back. Head all the way north for a
scene with... well, let's just say a rather large Fairy Godmother. After some
hilarious dialogue, she'll give you a [SUNDROP], [STARDROP], [MOONDROP], and a
[PLANETDROP] to aid you with raising your familiars. However, you'll now have to
help her with a rather... unique task, so it's off to find some comedians.

When you're done talking to the Fairy Godmother, head down the ladder and move
to the right/west; there's a hidden green chest up the tree beyond the large
rock that contains a [POISON PINCH]. Also look for a regular chest next to a
tree in this area for a [STRONG COFFEE]. Horace the ghost can also be found
here, provided you've spoken with him and performed all tasks he gave you in
previous towns. He wants to know what ingredient no burger can do without.
Looking at pages 92 and 132 of the Wizard's Companion should give a you clue:
the answer is of course 'Crispy Lettuce'. Horace will give you the [SAGE'S
SECRET FORMULA (010)] instead of the Levitate spell (which you must seek out
yourself).

Head back to town and look for Drippy's brothers Surly and Smiley at the Cavity
Club. After a hilarious dialogue (they ARE funny, but just don't know it), you
set off to find eight pieces of art.

Before doing any of that, head back to the entrance of the village and speak to
the seagull using 'Nature's Tongue' to receive the [LEVITATE] spell. As for the
pieces of art, the relevant fairies show up as light blue on your map, so
they're easy to spot.

 1. The long yellow fairy near the entrance is complaining about his large
    horns, so cast the Levitate spell and relieve him from this burden.

 2. Parry the Purrprietor (owner of the inn near the entrance). Set her ass on
    fire (with a proper Fireball) so she stops complaining about being so cold.

 3. The shop on to the right, just a little north from #2, has a green rabbit-
    like fairy who'd like to eat a nice dish; nothing the Secret Ingredient
    spell can't fix!

 4. Huw the Hootenanny from the Hootique further north has broken a jar; cast
    the Rejuvenate spell to fix it.

 5. Just a little northeast from the Hootique is a fairy that can't get the lid
    of a jar off. Casting the Spring Lock spell solves this.

 6. Head to the Cawtermaster and help him make his stuff heavier by casting the
    Burden spell.

 7. Look for a tiny fairy walking around town (check your map for a moving
    light blue dot) who needs his seeds grown; casting Quicken Growth helps him.

 8. Head to the shop in the southeast corner of town. Looks like the owner could
    use some brooming help; casting the Broom Broom spell solves this.

The [PIECES OF ART x8] that you received are enough to continue, but explore
the rest of town first. There's a chest nearby the shop where you got the 8th
piece of art, which contains [100 G]. Directly opposite of it - behind a tree -
is a blue chest with a [CHEESEBURGER] inside. There's a last chest to the far
west side opposite of the Cavity Club, at the start of the path leading to the
northern bridge; it contains a [FISHBURGER].

There are also two pieces of heart you can now collect. South of the Hootique
lies the shop with a giant squid on top of it. One of its customers has some
courage to spare, so stock up. Then there's the fairy in the southeast corner
of town (at a shop, near the small light blue neon stand) who has plenty of
restraint, so be sure to grab some of that as well.

As always, getting a night of rest at the Cat's Cradle nets you two more pages
in your Wizard's Companion, [TEEHEETI] and [THE FAIRYGROUND]. The Cawtermaster
also sells decent wares, most notably the Gale Spear, Massive Mallet and Gale
Robes.

If you hadn't already, now's an excellent time to create one or two Breezy
Cloaks (Sea Breeze Cloak + Angula x2).

When you're all set, talk to Surly and Smiley twice to enter Mummy's Tummy.

Mummy's Tummy - The Faycare Center
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
This is a straightforward area with several rooms in which you'll have to fight
creatures that have invaded the tummy and bullied the little fairies. It's good
to know that the fourth room from the left (the room without a picture on the
door) contains a Waystone, so heal up after each fight and save your game before
heading all the way to the right after the last battle. It's also a good idea to
equip any Burning Blades you have, while unequipping any water-inflicting
weapons. Breezy Cloaks are also an excellent piece of defensive equipment for
the upcoming boss battle.

When you're ready, proceed to the right for an unexpected battle.

 _________________________
| BOSS FIGHT: ROYAL JELLY |
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  STATS:   3180 HP, Weak against: Fire, Resists: Water
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯
  ATTACKS: 1. Physical Attack [Single Target, Minor Damage]
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ 2. See Stars [Single Target, Minor Damage, Confusion Ailment]
           3. Bolt from the Blue [All Targets, Medium to Major Damage,
              Storm Element, Use All-Out Defense!]
           4. Baby Shower [Creates 8 Jelly Baby enemies, Use All-Out Attack!]

  REWARDS: 1020 EXP, 1030 G, Spirit of the Storm
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
The fight with Royal Jelly isn't too hard if you come prepared with the right
equipment (defensive equipment resistant to storm, fire-inflicting Burning
Blades). Its physical attacks are weak, although its See Stars attack (get the
pun?) usually inflicts the confusion effect. Some familiars such as Thumbelemur
have a natural resistance, but there's a great chance someone will become
confused at some point in battle. Fortunately, the effect usually doesn't last
long, as they get hit by attacks soon enough.

The Bolt from the Blue attack hits all your party members for a fairly large
amount of damage, unless your familiar is equipped with a Breezy Cloak, which
makes a large difference. When you see Royal Jelly prepare this attack, quickly
launch an All-Out Defense command while defending with your current character
or familiar. Afterward, healing up with Sandwiches is generally a good idea.

Baby Shower creates eight Jelly Baby enemies and will be used after you've
depleted around 40% of the boss's health. You'll want launch an All-Out Attack
command (since Royal Jelly herself is weakened for the time being) and have a
familiar such as Mite use its ranged Cut Loose trick to greatly damage all the
jellyfish at once. There's a rather big chance that a constant stream of attacks
generates a golden glim; one of the AI controlled familiars might pick it up,
otherwise do so yourself while controlling Oliver; his Miracle Move is a fire
elemental attack and thus inflicts maximum damage.

Using a familiar like Thumbelemur in the final phase of the fight should allow
you to quickly finish off Royal Jelly with Go Wild.

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

After the battle you receive the Royal Jelly Page for your Wizard's Companion
and exit the Fairy Godmother's tummy. It's too easy to make a pun during this
scene, revolving mainly around the word "coming", but since it's so easy, we
won't do it. Nope. You won't hear us about the word "coming" at all. We also
will not refer to a putative type of birth rumored to exist.

In any case you'll also be given an enormous stock of spells by the Fairy
Godmother: [SHIFT SHAPE], [SECOND SELF], [MIMIC], [VANISH], [WERECAT],
[WEREFISH], [SHRINK], [OPEN MIND], [LOAF OF LIFE] and [POISON APPLE].

When you regain control, follow the star on your map to check on Drippy. Other
than that, there's not much to do in the village, so head back out to the world
map, then head back to your ship.

Speak to Sindbah, who is pleased to inform you that the Sea Cow has been
repaired and is ready to set sail once again. After getting aboard, several
scenes play and Drippy learns the Tidy Tears trick, sometimes performed in
battles. You also receive [THE THIRD TALE] of Wonder for your Wizard's
Companion. Better yet, a lot of errands can now be done by going back to The
Fairyground.

TIP: Now is an excellent time to metamorphose some more familiars into their
¯¯¯¯ second form if you haven't already done so. You'll gain a few levels during
     the errands that follow, but if you feel like that isn't enough, take a
     little more time off to regain most of your familiars' strength before
     proceeding with the story. Be sure to customize their tricks as they level
     up; you'll unlock plenty of useful ones.

Those are all errands on Teeheeti island, but there's one other errand you can
do, it just requires you to backtrack to the Golden Grove forest. The best way
to do this is by sailing around the east side of the Summerlands continent and
disembark at the beach of the Ding Dong Dell area. This also provides you with
an excellent opportunity to give Old Father Oak a visit, who's glad to hear of
your progress and rewards you with a [MEDAL OF DEXTERITY]. You'll want to
travel to Golden Grove afterwards.

| The fairy at the far south area of Golden Grove asks you to deal with the    |
| horrible hyperboars who have been troubling the forest, eating its mushrooms.|
| All Hyperboars are marked on your map, making them easy to find. The first   |
| two Hyperbores are accompanied by two Crashing Boars - lesser versions which |
| you should eliminate first - while the third Hyperboar is accompanied by     |
| three of those, so you might want to touch the nearby Waystone first.        |
|                                                                              |
| The battles themselves aren't too tough if you bring familiars who can dish  |
| out fire-elemental attacks - equip your Burning Blades for sure - and group  |
| hitting attacks such as Mite's Cut Loose work rather well. It's certainly    |
| good to know that all the boars can be blinded (by skills such as Mite's     |
| Sand Blast), so it's generally a good idea to blind the strongest boar at    |
| the start of the battle and then to follow up with an all-out attack while   |
| using group hitting skills manually. Do stay healthy and use healing spells  |
| or items should anyone fall below 40% of their max HP. Once they've fallen,  |
| return to the Waystone to heal and save.                                     |
|                                                                              |
| Return to the fairy, only to find that it's being attacked by an even        |
| stronger Full Bore (along with three Crashing Boars). Proper boss battle     |
| music may roll, then en't it? There's good! Your strategy from before works  |
| equally well in this battle, except it's going to be a little longer and     |
| tougher, and you'll want to watch your health a little more closely. After   |
| defeating the boars, you're finally given a reward for all your hard labor.  |

TIP: Out of the newly available Merit Awards, Crackerjack is probably the best
¯¯¯¯ since it increases the amount of experience you receive after battles by
     10%. Second best is Jack-o'-Lantern, which increases normal drops by 5%.

You're all set to sail to Hamelin, although there is one more stop you could
make; the optional No Longer Mine isle, which is just to the north-northeast of
Teeheeti / southeast of your destination. There are several treasures to be
found here, but the enemies, you've guessed it, will skin your hide before you
can say Wrath of the White Witch. Only the first treasure is easy to get (it's
on the beach), but the rest will definitely require you to be at full HP, MP,
guts, and have a stock of save files.

TIP: Remember that enemies on the world map can be briefly stunned by grabbing
¯¯¯¯ any item. Don't remove the item box but quickly run away to safety, giving
     you a small lead that might just save your life.

   No Longer Mine Island:
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
 • The first hidden treasure is easy (and safe) to find: inspect the lone rock
   on the beach to grab [SEE-THROUGH PIE x5].

 • The train tracks on the southwest part if the island run into a cliff.
   Inspect this location to find [RUBY RIPPLE ICE CREAM x5].

 • Follow these train track a little to the north until they fade out. Search
   the edge of the rocky cliff to find [CARNATION CAKE x5].

 • Keep following the tracks and curve around the rocks to the west. Search
   the inlet to find [BABANA FLAN x5]; this is all south of the ruined factory.

 • Head to the far west side of the island and move to the southwest corner;
   search here to find [FAIRY CHOCOLATE x5].

 • Check the (local) map of the island and head to the easternmost forest on
   the map, or better yet, slightly north-northwest of it, and search the soil
   here to find [WILDFLOWER SUNDAE x5].

 * The forage point on the north side of the island contains a nice [555 G].

When you're all done, set sail for Hamelin.

As usual, with a new area comes plenty of new hidden treasure to discover!

 * As soon as you disembark on the beach, you should see a forage point on the
   top of the left hill; it contains [SLUMBERNOT LEAVES].

 • Head up the hill east of the beach and go inside the ruins. You can find a
   cup of [STRONG COFFEE] at the southeastern end of the ruins, more precisely
   on the lower level where the walled path forms a dead-end.

 • Continue north until you reach a series of long tracks. From here, head
   directly west, all the way to the edge of the island. At the furthest western
   tip, move slightly south and search the cliff to find [GAUDY CLAWS], an
   excellent familiar weapon.

 • Head back to the large tracks and spot the ruined factory on the west side
   of it. Search the middle wall to find [400 G].

 * There's a forage point directly east of the ruined factory (and the large
   track) that gives [RAW STEEL].

 • Follow the southern edge of the western ravine to its far end to find a
   [SOFT SCOOP ICE CREAM].

 • Cross the ravine by walking over the long train tracks and follow the
   eastern tracks at the split. Search the spot where they hit the mountains to
   find a [DRILL SCREW].

 • Look for a factory ruin south of the previous treasure and search just south
   of the enormous chimney to find a [GAME PIE].

 • Head back to the large tracks, this time following the west split to its far
   northwest end; the mine entrance contains a [STONE-BE-GONE].

 * From here, head west-southwest to the far west side of the continent to find
   a forage point next to the ruins of an outpost; it contains a [RUMBLE NUT].

 • Just north of the former forage point is a hidden forest glade. The red chest
   contains a [LIGHTNING BOLT], an excellent spear. There's also a green chest
   to the south of the area. Finding Swaine's vantage point might be tricky;
   it's near the wall just south of the boy. Once you do find it, you'll receive
   a [PURIFYING PULSE GEM].

 • Move northwest past Hamelin to enter what is known as the Ghostly Gorge.
   Stay on the east side of the valley, but don't follow the mountain trail all
   the way to its end. Instead, look for a small cemetery and a tree just to
   the left side of the start of this narrowing path, near the ledge that would
   drop down further into the valley. Search the graves to find [600 G].

 * There's a forage point near a cemetery that is further to the west on the
   other side of the valley; it contains a [STURDY SHINBONE].

 • The cemetery directly west of the previous forage point (on the next level
   up, near the mountainside)  contains a [BASS BELL].

 * The forage point further north in Ghostly Gorge cannot be accessed yet. It
   contains [RAW STEEL], so you're not missing out on anything essential.

 * The last forage point is easy to spot and can be found at the extraction
   device just northeast of Hamelin. It holds a [SHADOWSTONE].

Once you have all that, it's time to visit the home of the next Great Sage:
Hamelin!

'——————————————————————————————————————''——————————————————————————————————————'

As soon as you enter the city, Swaine leaves the party. Follow the path to the
east and join up with him after several scenes. Head north and speak with the
guards that - who would've guessed - aren't allowing anyone in the palace. Now's
a good time to explore the city of Hamelin, and there are various errands and
bounties you can pursue as well.

Starting off in the northern area, look for a pot on the northwest side of the
street to find a [CARNATION CAKE]. The chest to the far southwest (of this
northern section of town) contains a [CONFUSION-BE-GONE], and there's also a
green chest far up the eastern building nearby. The vantage point for this chest
is slightly east of the southwesternmost street lantern; look east to spot the
chest on one of the balconies. It contains a [CLOCKWORK CLEAVER], a highly
offensive sword that reduces magic attack and accuracy but greatly boosts your
familiar's attack stat.

Directly north of this vantage point (but still in the southwest corner of the
northern part of town) one can find a pot with [30 - 60 G] inside. There's also
a blue chest in the southeast corner of this same section; it contains a
[CHEESEBURGER].

Head back to the east part of town and look for a pot in the corner opposite of
the Cawtermaster to find a [SALTED ICE CREAM or SOUR SUNDAE or SWEETIE PIE].
You can find a chest with [STRONG COFFEE] inside the Cawtermaster's building.
Be sure to buy most of the latest equipment; there are some fine pieces of
armor and weaponry among the wares. If you're short on cash, reconsider whether
you want to buy the latest ax or craft your own (which is better, but does
require a lot of ingredients - see below). The same applies for the Grunt Armor
(although it does grant a nice attack bonus).

Here are some useful items you may want to make with alchemy:

Watchmaker's Ax =    Iron Ax + Sprocket
Clockwork Ax =       Watchmaker's Ax + Drill Screw + Sprocket
Bone Mail =          Bass Bell + Sturdy Shinbone x2
Medal of Dexterity = Soldier's Sword + Bass Bell + Sprocket

Definitely chat with with man outside Swift Solutions to receive a large amount
of alchemy formulas: 003, 009, 011, 014, 019, 024, 029, 034, 039, 058, 078, 100,
116 and 122. There is also a pot just to the west of Swift Solutions with an
[ICED COFFEE] inside.

Make sure to also chat with Horace, who's looking over the town from the balcony
near the Hootique. The answer to his new riddle can be found on pages 212-213
of the Wizard's Companion, and the number of automata familiars is of course 5.
Give him the answer and he'll reward you with the [CHART CHESTS] spell, which
marks unfound chests and treasures in dungeons and towns (but not on the world
map, unfortunately).

There are a few more pots you haven't found yet, so go ahead and cast the chart
chests spell to locate them more easily. There's one next to the Cat's Cradle
on the right side that contains a [CURSE-BE-GONE], and heading down the west
path of town makes you run into the remaining pots, which holds [30 - 60 G] and
a [BABANA FLAN] respectively (the last one is on the left side of the stairs
around the corner). Lastly, check out the Hootique to find a chest with a
[NIX-BE-GONE] item inside.

TIP: Now's also a good time to collect two pieces of heart in the main street/
¯¯¯¯ northern section of Hamelin; enthusiasm (northwest at main street), and
     restraint (southwest at main street).

With all of those treasures out of the way, time to take on some tasks at Swift
Solutions!

| Fluvius Maximus can be found in the ruins to the far south of Autumnia, near |
| the beach you left the Sea Cow. It's got a fairly large amount of HP, but    |
| that doesn't necessarily make this a hefty battle. It resists water and is   |
| weak against fire, so a burning blade can make a nice difference. Keep       |

When you're done with any errands and bounties you wanted to complete, head to
the black market in the southwest corner of the city and use it to sneak past
the palace guards to the far north.

Inside the palace you'll have to sneak past several guards, which is easier
than it looks.

          Start

Following the above map, perform the following steps:

NOTE: Guards can only see half a hall at a time, and cannot spot you in alcoves.
¯¯¯¯¯ 
1. Look to the east, spotting the guard making his way to the left and right.
   As he moves away - while at the same time the guard up north is also moving
   away from you, run up to, and hide in the northern alcove.
   
2. As the guard passes, make your way to the center of the area, following the
   guard patrolling the central hall, but stop at the corner.

3. At the corner, make sure the guard in the hall to the northwest isn't looking
   your direction, then make your way to the southern hall where you can hide
   just around the corner.

4. When the guard in the easternmost hall moves north, follow him to hide in the
   alcove in the northeast of the area.

5. As both the guard in the east and northern halls move away from you, quickly
   make a run for the exit nearby.

Before you drop down the manhole it is wise te review what your familiars are
equipped with. The next boss is weak against storm based attacks, but resists
physical damage. You have at least one familiar capable of exploiting this
weakness (Drongo), but you might have more (Dumbelemur at level 25+). In any
case, equipping your might with a Roc Feather is a good idea, even if it drops
its attack somewhat. The Lightning Bolt is by far the best spear to equip for
this battle.

| BOSS FIGHT: PORCO GROSSO |
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  STATS:   2540 HP, Weak against: Storm, Resists: Physical
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯
  ATTACKS: 1. Hog Roast
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ 2. Road Hog
           3. Porco Salvo [Single Target, Medium to Major Damage,
                           Use Defend + All-Out Defense!]
           4. Gammon Cannon [Single Target, Major Damage, Used when its HP
                             falls below 30%, Use Defend + All-Out Defense,
                             Heal party beforehand]

  REWARDS: 1130 EXP, 1630 G, Hog's Cog
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Porco Grosso is Hamelin's toughest enemy and physical attacks are basically
harmless against it, so you'll mostly want to stick with magic and tricks.
Mostly - because equipping Mite with the Roc Feather, and any spear-using
familiars with a Lightning Bolt is a good idea, allowing them to do at least
a little more damage with regular physical attacks.

Nonetheless, your Drongo will play an important role in this battle, as will any
other familiars with storm-based tricks. Definitely perform an All-Out attack
when the boss is weakened, and have Oliver grab the golden glim to perform his
Burning Heart attack, which always deals decent damage.

Keep your health up by using Sandwiches and healing spells, and if things are
going smooth, have Swaine steal the boss's Tower Toppler, which you might've
already bought from the Cawtermaster, but it's a good and valuable piece of
equipment nonetheless.

When the boss drops below 30% of its HP, it will start using a powerful attack
called Gammon Cannon. This generally deals above 100 points of damage, so
healing your party right before its HP drops to 30%, followed up with an
All-Out defense plus Defend command is a wise move. If someone gets knocked out,
do consider reviving them with a Phoenix Down, heal them back up, then finish
the battle with a few All-Out attacks.

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

After a few cutscenes you'll be magically transported to the Hamelin of the
past. More scenes will play until you're finally required to investigate a mine
where the Emperor's young princes have gone. Visit the Cat's Cradle to heal up
(if necessary), then go to the world map and check out the mine located in the
mountains southeast of Hamelin. You'll find Gascin and Marcassin (the Emperor's
sons) under attack by a giant Earth Ogrrr. The beast is easily taken care of,
so have Gascin 'escort' you back to the castle afterwards. You'll be given the
[ARROW OF LIGHT] spell, which deals light elemental damage and is particularly
effective against undead/dark enemies.


TOMBSTONE TRAIL - WIGGLING ROAD TO RUIN [WLK-4.3]
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
ITEMS: [ ] Curse-Be-Gone, [ ] Cheeseburger, [ ] Black Blade, [ ] Curse-Be-Gone,
¯¯¯¯¯¯ [ ] Misty Shroud, [ ] Avenger's Badge, [ ] Devil's Fang, [ ] Mornstar

________________________________________________________________________________

Travel through the Ghostly Gorge to the northwest of Hamelin and use your Bridge
spell to close the gap that was previously blocked by a Hamelin Boar, who
must've gotten boared by standing there all day. Be sure to collect the hidden
treasure at the graves in the far northeast corner to find a [MIRRORED ARMOR].
The Tombstone Trail can be entered on the far north side by traveling underneath
the bridge you just crafted.

As you enter you'll receive the [ROGUE'S REVOLVER FORMULA (128)], so be sure to
craft one for Swaine if you have the ingredients. It's important to know that
there are Curse Traps lying around this area; dark spots that inflict the curse
status ailment on Oliver and his friends, which slows them down significantly
both in the field and in battles. It only lasts several seconds, but enemies
can easily catch up with you during this time. It's best to altogether avoid
the dark cursed spots by casting the Levitate spell to float over them.

Take the right path (the left branch leads to a dead end with a Curse Trap) -
ignoring the double doors for now - until you reach a broken bridge. Cast
Bridge, right? Nope! Ah.. Levitate right over it then, huh!? Nope! Only the
Rejuvenate spell allows you to continue. In any case, collect a handy [CURSE-BE-
GONE] from the chest to the right of the bridge and continue climbing the trail.

At the intersection, head over the wooden plank to collect a [CHEESEBURGER] from
the chest at the far end (but be sure to avoid or levitate over the Curse Trap
near the graves). Mr. Skeleton at the end of the other path isn't about to let
you though so give him a whoop... Actually, cast the Rotten Apple spell when
Oliver has the '?' mark above his head and you'll fake your way through.

You'll be at a three-way intersection; the left path contains a green chest
with a [BLACK BLADE]. The right path leads to a dead and with a Curse Trap, so
take the middle path leading west to proceed. You'll reach a shack with a nearby
Waystone; after the scene you can collect a [CURSE-BE-GONE] from the pot hidden
behind the shack. Take note of the broken robot and continue onwards.

The path will get rather dark at some point, so cast the Magic Lamp spell to
light the way for you, and be sure to cast this spell whenever you see candles
along the path to provide you with a more permanent light. In fact, this it is
a requirement to lit all seven unlit candles in this area before you can
continue.

The path splits here; the one to the northwest has a chest at its end that
contains a [MISTY SHROUD] and an unlit candle, while the other dead end to the
far west has just an unlit candle. Head back to the intersection, cast the
Levitate spell and take the right trail, which will once again split up. Before
you reach the intersection, be sure to lit the three unlit candles along the
way, the last one being in an alcove to the east.

There's a chest with an [AVENGER'S BADGE] at the end of the northwest trail, as
well as the final unlit candle, clearing the rock wall to the east. Recast
Levitate (if necessary) and search behind the tree in the northeast corner to
find a blue chest with a [DEVIL'S FANG]. 

Heal up at the Waystone up ahead and save your game before diving into the next
boss fight.

| BOSS FIGHT: CANDELABRACADABRA |
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  STATS:   3130 HP, Weak against: Light, Resists: Fire, Dark
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯   Steal: Noble Attire

  ATTACKS: 1. Physical Attack [One Target, Minor Damage]
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ 2. Boo! [All Targets, Minor Damage, Inflicts Curse]
           3. Snuff Out [All Targets, Inflicts Blindness]
           4. Wacko Lantern [All Targets, Medium to Major Damage]

  REWARDS: 1290 EXP, 1750 G, 
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Candelabracadabra is a surprisingly easy boss to beat, but that's mostly thanks
to your newly acquired Arrow of Light spells, which tends to generate various
glims - including golden ones - so be sure to cast the spell a lot by using
Oliver.

Its physical attacks are swift and the other attacks can inflict Curse and
Blindness on you and your familiars, although it shouldn't make too much of a
difference. What you'll really want to look out for is its Wacko Lantern attack,
which hits all party members for a decent amount of damage. Be sure to quickly
perform an All-Out Defense when you see Candel cast this.

If you have the battle under control, definitely steal the Noble Attire from it,
an excellent cloak for one of your familiars. 

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Afterward you'll finally be able to claim the [MORNSTAR] as your own, and a
clue is given to you as to how you managed to travel back in time. Return to
Hamelin by using the nearby teleport. As you travel back, a scene plays, and
even more scenes will play when you reach the Emperor. After all this, collect
a piece of belief from young Marcassin and cast the [BREACH TIME] spell you've
gotten just now. In the present, cure Marcassin and he'll grant you the [WARD],
[FUSE], [INSIGHT] and [TRAVEL] spells, the last being extremely handy as it
allows you to teleport to any places you've already visited.


  At this point in the game you open up a lot of optional content that you can now
visit, explore, pursue or complete. Here's a handy list of all things that you
can currently undertake:

 • Revisit Old Father Oak to visit a [HEALING TEAR GEM] plus a page in your
   Wizard's Companion (304).

 • Errands #012 - #018, #077, #082, and Bounties #098 - #102 have opened up.
   You can also complete Errand #008 (from the Fairyground, which you had to
   leave open for now). See below for details on the errands.

 • You can visit the Crypt Casino at the Tombstone Trail. There are various
   prizes you can buy with your Chips, but the Crownberries and Big Babana, as
   well as the Bluster Blade are currently the most worthy of your efforts. The
   first two alchemy items are used to create the most powerful treats, while
   the blade is quite decent storm-based sword for this moment in the game.

 • You can revisit Sage Solomon at the Temple of Trials and participate in the
   Solosseum, in which you fight various consecutive battles. For now, Rank E is
   most likely the best you can manage. It helps to equip a Burning Blade for
   this rank, or use familiars with fire-based abilities. You'll have to fight
   three battles; order Oliver and Swaine not to use any abilities in the first
   battle, heal with Esther while having them perform All-Out attacks on the
   enemy and kill the Ruffian first. The second battle can be fought the same
   way, but spare one creature in order to heal up for the tougher third round.
   Focus on a single enemy (and allow Oliver and Swaine to use abilities this
   time), such as the Danglerfish. With only two enemies left, heal your party
   and swiftly take them out one by one with All-Out attacks. You'll be rewarded
   with a [DRAGON TUSK] and [2000 G].

   TIP: Normally Rank D will be too tough for you to handle at this point in the
   ¯¯¯¯ game, but if you level up a lot on Ugly Duckling Island (see below,
        under Autumnia Islands Exploration) then you should be able to tackle
        it nonetheless. The reward is a [HOT-BLOODED BADGE] and [5000 G].

 • The islands surrounding Autumnia can be explored. This was already possible,
   but you're much better prepared now. Below are more details.

 • Now's also a good time to explore the islands southwest of the Summerlands.
   There are plenty of items and mini-sidequests to be done there, and the
   westernmost island of the bunch (The Hermit's Shell) also has a forage point
   that gives a [METEORITE FRAGMENT]. If you've collected one of these (from
   here) before, you can now make the excellent Barrier Badge (Iron Shield +
   Meteorite Fragment x2 + Sprocket x2]. It grants +15 defense and magic defense
   while lowering evasion and accuracy by 5 points.

   The cave on this island is filled with familiars that you can speak to with
   Nature's Tongue. There are five mini-quests to be done here:

   1. The Naiads want two Carnation Cakes and a Carrot Cake. Your reward is a
      [SAGE'S SECRET]. (The Cakes are easily made through alchemy.)

   2. There's a Clinketyclank who wants three Sprockets. Be sure to first craft
      the Barrier Badge (see right above), since that takes an absolute priority
      in terms of rewards. You can collect any further Sprockets from Sprog Cogs
      in the southern parts of Autumnia; either steal them or wait for a drop.
      Your reward will be a [THUNDERSPARK GEM].

   3. The Puss in Boats want two Well-Worn Swords. You can simply buy these from
      the Cawtermaster in Ding Dong Dell. Your reward is a [POISON PINCH GEM].

   4. Mister Jackpotty wants to meet a fellow familiar. Catching a potty is
      possible by fighting them at sea nearby Shipwreck Shore, southeast of the
      Shimmering Sands. The reward for this is [PIXIE DEW x3].

   5. The Duncecap has a similar request. It wants to meet a fellow mushroom
      familiar. Catch one in Golden Grove if you don't have one and bring it
      back; the reward are [GLOWCAPS x5].

      If you fulfill all five requests, you'll also get the [NAME TAG], which
      allows you to rename any of your familiars. J-RPG classic!

Of course you can also set sail to find Kublai, in which case you'll need to
travel to the northeast part of the Summerlands continent, toward the Skull
Mountain. 


   Autumnia Islands Exploration:
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
 • The isle east of Autumnia is called The Spindle, and its inhabitants are
   fairly strong. You can only partially explore the island at this time, but
   there's a hidden treasure that can be found nonetheless. Move around the
   rocks to the south and search the westernmost cliff to collect a [PIXIE DEW].

   Unfortunately, the island to the northeast of Autumnia - The Broken Crown -
   cannot be accessed by the Sea Cow as it has no beaches. Note it for later.

 • Of much more interest are the islands northwest of Autumnia. The largest
   island is known as Swan Island and you'll meet some 'familiar' faces there
   (Mite, Thumbelemur, Drongo, Seed Sprite). The first hidden treasure on Swan
   Island is easy to find: move south from the beach and search the base of the
   mountains right between two small forests to find [SUNDROP x2].

 • Still on Swan Island, follow the northeast trail to its end and search the
   soil for [500 G]. Not bad!

 * There's also a useful forage point on the west side of Swan Island that nets
   you [FOGDROP], an ingredient used in several alchemy formulas.

 • Visit the small island west of Swan Island and walk over the beach the tiny
   adjacent isle. Search the south area to collect [BABANA FLAN x2].

 • The small island west of Swan Island contains a hidden treasure itself;
   search the northernmost tip of it to find a [CAPPUCINO].

 * The island south of Swan Island is called Ugly Duckling Isle. The forage
   point here contains an [ANGULA].

 • The northernmost tip of the Ugly Duckling Isle contains [RUBY RIPPLE ICE
   CREAM x2].

   TIP: Ugly Duckling Island is home to a fairly uncommon creature known as
   ¯¯¯¯ Toko; green and round staff-wielding cowards. You can encounter them
        on the world map but also as part of other enemy teams (but only on this
        island). Since they give a whooping 2000 EXP points, this is an amazing
        place to level your characters up into their late 30's, early 40's even.
        It's also a good idea to metamorphose some of your familiars into their
        third form, since it only takes a couple of battles to have them back
        at their former strength. You'll ALWAYS want to take out Toko's first,
        and preferably approach enemies from their backs to give you a slight
        advantage; Toko's tend to run away quickly. Powerful skills combined
        with an All-Out attack (+ attack leader's target) should counter this.

 • You can also visit the northwest part of Autumnia by disembarking at the
   western beach of the continent, which gives access to a mountain trail with
   very powerful enemies. If you've levelled up to around level 40 (for your
   characters) you should be able to defeat them, but not without difficulty,
   so it's better to avoid any enemies here for now. If you want to take a risk
   for a rather decent treasure, save your game on the beach and head to the
   far end of the trail. Search the area northeast of the stone at the end to
   find a [PHOENIX BREATH] item, which has the power to revive your entire party
   to full health and is supremely useful in the final dungeon(s).

 * There's also a forage point at the end of this mountain trail that holds
   a [PLANET CRYSTAL], an item used in alchemy.
