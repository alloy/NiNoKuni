                       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Every once in a while you come across a story which, once you've plunged your
mind into it, doesn't let go of you. Soaked with meaning and hidden layers to
explore, it opens up an entire new world. Structured by the laws of our own
existential lives - yet different in all the details - it manages to captivate
and intrigue not only yourself, but generations to come.

The modern age has shaped a landscape in which spaces have been created that
allow people to tell narratives in different ways. Movies and TV-series are
but examples of the wide diversity of media that emerged in the 20th century.
The space in which video games shine has only opened up in recent decades and
by the looks of its main stream of output appears to be in it's puberty.

It opens up fantastic possibilities to craft narratives in ways unseen before
and it's wonderful to witness every once in a while a game that makes full use
of the semantic potential that the videogame medium contains deep down; an
ability to shape a whole unique lifeworld in which one can dwell and live.

That is exactly what Ni no Kuni manages to do. Playing such a videogame means
nothing other than merging your regular 'lifeworld' with an other lifeworld, in
this case a world fully created by human beings. This differs from reading a
book or watching a movie in an important sense, namely that the subject's free
will literally start playing a role; one gets the feeling of *exploring* a
lifeworld rather than being a spectator. Appropriate music has the power to
enhance the intensity of this feeling, and our fancy is pampered by dynamic
and imaginative environments and creatures.

The feeling of exploration is not an unimportant element of video games, and
especially if one already has the expectation to be drawn into another world,
it's a very disappointing experience to find a linear path drawn out for you;
in an almost unlawful fashion are you stripped from a portion of expected
freedom.

Studio Ghibli has managed to create a beautiful lifeworld that will surely
enchant you. In the end, be it in the form of a tragic yet wonderful graphic
novel such as Jimmy Corrigan by C. Ware, or in the shape of a movie like Let The
Right One In, or in the fashion of Ni no Kuni, what really matters is a
lifeworld's ability to charm its visitors in a singular way and leave a lasting
impression to be shared with others. We can safely assure you that Ni no Kuni
lives up to its name: Another World.

While it's the duty of the creator(s) to craft the above potential, it's the
explorer's responsibility to truly do a lifeworld justice. Just like a tourist
ought to take his time exploring a new city in order to discover new things
worthy of attention, so too does a digital lifeworld require proper attention
and efforts. A travel guide for those prepared to undertake this not always
light hearted quest might thus be a welcome subsidiary.

As such, we do not share the opinion that guides take the fun out of games.
It's perfectly understandable should someone want to explore a world all by
themselves at first, but he who wishes to master the art of exploration better
stands on the shoulders of giants before him, to truly turn every turnable
stone. We hope this strategy guide aids you in doing fully justice to the
magnificent lifeworld of Ni no Kuni. It deserves it.

                                BASICS [BSC-2]
                                ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
 NOTE: These are just quick bullet points to show what can be done. The full
 ¯¯¯¯¯ entries can be viewed in-game after you're given the Telling Stone
       after the Guardian of the Woods boss battle.

 • Walking - Use the LEFT ANALOG STICK to move. Tilting it slightly will let you
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   walk, whereas tilting it further will let you run.

 • Talking - Whenever a SPEECH BUBBLE appears, press the CROSS button to speak.
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
 • Points of View - Use the RIGHT ANALOG STICK to adjust your viewpoint. You can
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   also press the R3 button to switch to a first person
                    perspective.

 • Mini Map - On the top right corner of the screen is your mini map. It shows
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   the area in your immediate vicinity. Press the SELECT button to
              hide it if you like.

 • Local Map - Press the R1 button in the field to show your local map, which
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   shows a bird's eye view of the wider area around you.

               For either map, your next destination is usually marked with a
               YELLOW STAR.

 • Save Yourself - When you are in towns, or traveling the field (read: World
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   Map,) you can save your game by accessing the Main Menu and
                   pressing START.

 • Way of the Waystone - Waystones are the mysterious stones you will come
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   across in your journey that will restore all your HP
                         and MP. These monoliths will also allow you to save
                         your game.

 • Meeting Monsters - You'll encounter many monsters in the field. When they
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   become aware of your presence, a (!) will appear above
   their heads, and they will give chase. Battle will commence when they close
   to within touching distance. Be aware that you can get the first strike in
   battle by approaching them from behind and they don't notice. This works both
   ways, for you and the monsters. In other words, if monsters approach your
   back, they will have the upper hand in battle.

 • Taking Hearts - Should someone prove willing to share a particular virtue
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   with you, you may pocket a piece of heart with the Take Heart
                   spell, which will be stored in the Locket.

 • Giving Hearts - The only way to cure the brokenhearted is to share a piece of
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   heart from one who has an abundance of a particular virtue.
   Once you have a piece of heart, you must use the Give Heart spell to cure the
   brokenhearted.

 • When the Locket glows - As your journey progresses, the Locket will glow upon
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   occasion. It responds to those who have an abundance
   of a virtue; their souls will be highlighted on the Mini Map, so be sure
   collect their pieces of heart.

 • <#09, MISSING>

 • About the Main Menu - Pressing TRIANGLE will access the Main Menu. From
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   there, just use the D-Pad and the CROSS button to make
                         your choices, and CIRCLE to exit altogether.

 • The Bottomless Bag - This bag contains the full array of items you've
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   acquired. Items are divided into different categories,
   and you can use L1 and R1 to switch between them. Consumable items can be
   used there and then by pressing CROSS--ideal for restoring HP and MP.

 • Your Party's Abilities - In the Main Menu, select Friends & Familiars to
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   access your party's information. HP (Health Points)
   represents health, while MP (Magic Points) represents magical power
   available. Movement Speed and Attack Speed are self-explanatory; the more
   STARS you have, the faster you are. Attack determines how strong your
   physical attacks are, while Defense influences the amount of physical damage
   taken. Magical Attack and Magical Defense act the same way, but with magical
   damage. Evasion indicates the chances of avoiding an attack, while Accuracy
   determines how likely your attacks will succeed. Exp. indicates your
   experience level; it will increase as you gain experience, as shown by the
   Exp. to Next Level field.

 • Tricks and Commands - Skills learned by creatures are known as tricks; you
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   can see them by selecting Friends & Familiars in the
   Main Menu. Tricks take up a single command slot, and regardless of how many
   are learned, they can only use a set few in battle; set them by using the
   TRIANGLE button. As for tricks themselves, each familiar can only learn a
   maximum of EIGHT. After that, it must forget old tricks to learn new ones.


                                 TIPS [BSC-3]
                                 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
 • "Perfect" Gamesave - Unique Items - If you are interested in maximizing
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   the entire inventory in Ni no Kuni, you
   will want to consult the small section [ITM-1] to see which items are
   permanently missable and what you must watch out for to keep the potential
   for a "perfect save file. Regular players may skip this section.

 • Treasure hunting (towns/dungeons) - As to be expected from an RPG, Ni no Kuni
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   has a lot of treasures for you to find.
   Many of them are hidden in chests, others in pots with sparkling glitter.
   This walkthrough covers all treasure in the game and includes complete item
   lists. Note that some chests are sealed with magic. Later in the game you'll
   be able to open blue chests, and still later, purple and green chests as
   well. This sometimes requires you to backtrack to previous areas. Also note
   that twinkling treasure (such as the ones in pots) will recover their
   contents over time, allowing you to collect treasure from them over and over
   again. It does take about 15 minutes for them to restore the contents, so
   make yourself useful in the meantime.

 • Colored treasure chests - As mentioned above, some chests cannot be opened.
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   These are different in color from the regular, red
   treasure chests. Blue chests require you to have and cast the 'Spring Lock'
   spell, which is acquired early in the game. Purple chests also require the
   Mornstar wand (gotten later in the game). Green chests require you to have
   progressed far enough to have Swaine in your party.

 • Old Father Oak - Be sure to visit Old Father Oak every once in a while to
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   tell him of your adventures and he'll often reward you with
   precious items. This walkthrough tells you exactly when you can expect Mr.
   Oak to hand out new precious treasures.

 • Socializing - It doesn't have to become your hobby, but in Ni no Kuni it's
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   smart to talk to NPC's, visit stores, and rest at each inn.
   The latter will even grant you missing pages from the Wizard's Companion,
   and NPC's sometimes have important information to tell.

 • Approaching Enemies - Ni no Kuni features semi-random battles, and you'll be
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   able to spot creatures from far away, especially on the
   world map, which gives you the opportunity to approach them from behind or
   avoid them altogether. If you manage to sneak up on your enemy, you'll have
   the upper hand in battle, essentially giving you a free round of attacks.
   But if an enemy ambushes you (approaches you from behind), then they will be
   the ones with a free round of attacks. If this happens, run around in battle
   like a headless chicken until you're good to go. If you notice a fast
   creature that you can't outrun is chasing you, it's best to turn around and
   face it like a man; that way you won't have to deal with ambushes.

 • Stunning Enemies - There are times when you'll want to avoid enemies on the
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   world map, especially when you're exploring an island
   that you aren't really supposed to explore to get collect some really nice
   treasures. In such cases it's good to know that there's a little trick that
   might just save your hide once or twice. Whenever you pick up a (hidden)
   treasure on the world map, including the ones from forage points, enemies
   are briefly stunned. This is to grant you time to pick up the item. However,
   the stun lasts slightly longer than the instant Oliver himself is immobile.
   Don't cancel the text box; simply run away in the direction you want to
   move, giving you a small headstart.
   
   This trick can also be performed by talking to Drippy on the world map, but
   that requires a little more skill. Nonetheless, since Drippy is almost always
   available, there's plenty enough room for practice!

 • Elementary Elements - In Ni no Kuni there are six categories in which damage
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   can be place: five elemental affinities, and Physical
   damage. The elements are Fire, Water, Storm, Light and Darkness. If you
   manage to exploit an enemy's elemental weakness, you'll do roughly +50%
   damage, indicated by orange numbes. If an enemy resists the element you're
   using, blue figures will mark this. Be sure to consult this walkthrough for
   tips on when to exploit creature's elemental weaknesses. You can use skills
   that are element-laden, but there are also weapons with this feature.
   You'll also want to defend yourself against enemies' elemental tricks
   whenever possible. Some familiars have elemental weaknesses and resistances,
   so keep track of those; especially right before boss battles.

 • Status Ailments - Enemies - especially strong foes - sometimes have the
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   ability to inflict status ailments upon you and your
   familiars. Below is a table with their effects, duration and cure. All status
   ailments are automatically lifted after battle.

 • Stamina in battles - While your main characters can be used as long as you'd
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   like, familiars have a stamina bar (displayed round
   their icon in battle) that will sooner or later be depleted. When this
   happens, their stats will be impaired and it takes longer for the stamina
   bar to fill up than normal, so it's usually for the better to call your
   familiar back when it's about to run out of energy, swapping it for another.

 • Defend, Evade & Psyche-Up - While each main character always has the Defend
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   command at their disposal (which lasts for
   several seconds and halves damage) some familiars have this replaced with
   either the Evade or Psyche-Up commands. Evade is similar in execution to
   Defend, except it lasts much shorter so you'll need to time it rather
   precisely. If successfully done, you'll evade the attack without taking any
   damage whatsoever. The Psycho-Up command works differently. Using this will
   cause the familiar to charge up their energy; after this, their regular
   attack command changes into the 'Go Wild' command, which allows them to
   attack more frequently and more forcefully. While these familiars lack the
   Defend skill, they can (sometimes) nonetheless cancel enemy attacks when
   they're ravaging them during their frenzy. This isn't guaranteed, however,
   so it's always a bit of a risk you're taking.

 • Cancelling enemy attacks - When an enemy is performing a trick, repeatedly
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   bashing it with attacks of your own may stagger
   your foe, cancelling their attack. The chance that this happens isn't very
   high, although you can increase this by using the Go Wild command (if
   available to you). Cancelling enemy attacks basically falls under the
   category, 'offense is the best defense'. While sometimes true, it's
   certainly not always the case, since some enemy tricks can't be cancelled
   at all.

 • Counterattacking - It's possible to perform a counterattack on foes by
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   waiting with entering the attack command until you notice
   your enemy is going to attack you. At that time, your attack command should
   flash blue for an instant; quickly press it to counter your enemy's attack,
   leaving them stunned, cancelling their own attack. It's especially hard to
   counterattack swift enemies' attacks, but it's certainly not essential to
   attempt this anyway.

 • Glims on the battlefield - As you're fighting off enemies, green and blue
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   glims will occassionally appear. The green ones
   heal a small portion of your HP while the blue ones heal some of your
   MP. It's a good idea to grab these whenever possible so you can save your
   precious healing items.

 • Golden Glims & Miracle Moves - When you've performed reasonably well in a 
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   battle - usually longer boss battles - you
   might find a golden glim on the battlefield. Be sure to immediately collect
   these, since they don't hang around forever. It'll complete restore your
   health and grants access to your character's or familiar's Miracle Move,
   a limit break-like attack that usually does massive damage, although some
   inflict status effects or provide a splendid healing of your party. The best
   way to generate a gold glim is to stun an enemy/boss by exploiting their
   weak spot, although defending against tricks also tends to work well. See
   the table below for more information on generating glims.

.—————————————————————————————.——————————————————————————————————.—————————————.
|ACTION:                      |CHANCE FOR GENERATING HP/MP GLIMS:|GOLDEN GLIMS:|
|=============================|==================================|=============|

 • Post-battle fun: Health & Magic Glims - It's a good idea in general to snatch
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   the green health and blue magic glims
   from the battlefield, but it doesn't have to end when all foes have been
   defeated. If there are any glims nearby, you'll still have a second or so
   left to grab these, granting you free HP and MP.

 • Keeping 'em imprisoned - Once you get your second teammember it becomes
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   possible to catch familiars. Be sure to do so
   whenever the opportunity arises! You never know when the beasties may come
   in handy, during the various errands of the game for example.

 • Losing isn't fun - But it's not the end of the (another) world either.
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   Instead, it'll cost you 10% of your Guilders to revive
   your party. Obviously the best remedy is not to lose, and if you've recently
   saved your game, reloading is an option. But if you'd otherwise lose too much
   progress, definitely consider paying the price to cheat death, unless you're
   attempting some kind of challenge run or perfect game.

 • Battle Spoils & Thievery - Most enemies in the game have a common and a rare
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   drop, which roughly vary between 10-25% and 2-5%
   respectively in chance. Once you get Swaine in your party, stealing items
   from creatures becomes an option. Again, enemies have a common and a rare
   item that you can steal, which vary roughly between 20-35% and 5-25%
   respectively. Many items can only or mainly be gotten from creatures.

 • Healing up - It's a good idea to keep your health high at all times. An
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   additional reason for this is that your MP bar tends to be
   full(er) if you refrain from using powerful magic against regular foes;
   these still drop MP glims, however, which would go to waste if you're already
   powered up magic-wise.

 • Errands (sidequests) - Once you reach the first town in Another World, you'll
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯    be able to run errands for several citizens. You can
   start an errand either by heading to Swift Solutions (in which errands and
   bounties are sorted all together), or by speaking to individual citizens
   themselves. The rewards vary, but as a rule of thumb it's always best to do
   errands as soon as they become available, because your compensation won't be
   so rewarding when you complete them later in the game.

 • Bounty Hunting - Similar to errands, bounty hunting requires you to deal with
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   a certain fiend that's usually bothering or endangering
   NPC's. You're given an indication as where to look for the critters, and this
   walkthrough has detailed information available on each and every bounty as
   they become available to you.

 • Merit Cards, Stamps & Rewards - Errands and bounties grant you 'merit stamps'
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   besides just decent rewards. Once you fill up
   a merit card you can exchange it for rewards at Swift Solutions, or save it
   up for more pricey rewards. Note that after approximately 10 tasks you'll be
   given a bonus stamp. Once you pass the 100 tasks, these bonuses become
   larger. There are exactly enough stamps to purchase all rewards.

 • Full Fledged Alchemist - Once you unlock alchemy it becomes possible to mix
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   items into better ones via recipes. You'll be able
   to get recipes from NPC's, but you don't necessarily need to have an in-game
   recipe ready to be a good alchemist. In fact, you can also try to mix and
   match items; if it doesn't work out, you'll get to keep the items. This guide
   lists all possible recipes for you.

 • Twinkling Forage Locations - These twinkling stars are markers for spots on
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   the world map that contain items. They're not
   quite the same as hidden treasures, because these twinkling locations will
   recover their treasure over time. Come back after a while to harvest more.

 • (Hidden) Treasures on the World Map - There are many treasures to be found on
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   the world map. If you find 100 of them,
   you'll be awarded a Silver Trophy, but the treasures themselves are usually
   worth your trouble by themselves. You'll eventually get a spell that makes
   the hidden treasures visible, but it's advisable to follow this walkthrough
   with tips on where to find them, since if you wait too long, their usefulness
   will be greatly diminished due to better available equipment you've gathered.

 • (Hidden) World Map Locations - We've gone over hidden treasures, but like a
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   proper J-RPG, Ni no Kuni also features hidden
   locations on the world map. Hints are usually given in the game by NPC's or
   in some other fashion, and this walkthrough will leave none of them
   unexplored. Regardless, there are roughly two types of hidden areas: forest
   zones and caves. Carefully search forests and explore mountains to see if you
   can spot them by yourselves.


                               FAMILIARS [BSC-4]
                               ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
 • Familiar Signs - Depending on what sign your familiar has, they'll receive
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   bonuses against specific elemental attacks and status
   ailments. But there's more. The Sun - Moon - Star triangle is especially
   important to memorize: Sun beats Moon beats Star beast Sun. When a sign beats
   an other sign, it means the familiar deals +20% to that enemy. However, if
   a sign loses from an other sign (such as, Sun loses from Star), then that
   Sun familiar deals -20% to the Star familiar (while the Star enemy deals +20%
   damage to your familiar).

   The Planet and Double Planet signs are exceptions to this triangle. A Planet
   sign is neutral to the three regular signs, but deals +50% damage to the
   Double Planet sign. The Double Planet sign is an all-round sign, dealing +10%
   damage to all three normal signs (including the 'Double' ones), and no
   additional damage to the Planet sign.

   It's important to know that many strong creatures you'll face are of the
   Sun sign (including many bounties), which makes the Star sign a good choice
   for your familiars. Obviously the Planet and Double Planet signs are good
   as well, but they're also considerably more rare.

 • Gaining experience - Each party member can hold three familiars with them to
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   use at any time in battle, plus an additional three
   'reserves' which you can select from the menu when you're not in a battle.
   The three active familiars - the ones selectable in battle - will always
   receive the full battle experience spoils, so it's an excellent idea to have
   a strong familiar that you use often, level up an other familiar or two in
   the other slots.

 • Feeding Familiars - You can feed familiars treats, which boost their primary
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   ability, as well as their familiarity (or love for you).
   A familiar can only eat 10 treats at a time; by then all their stomach slots
   are filled, which means calories need some burning. This is done by battling,
   and each battle you fight empties a stomach slot of all your familiars (it
   doesn't matter if they fight themselves or not).

   A familiar's six stats/abilities can be boosted for a maximum of 50 points
   (for all stats combined). Moreover, you're only allowed to boost a familiar's
   stats 10 points for each familiarity heart you've completely filled up. If
   you've filled up two hearts, that means you can boost a familiar's stats for
   a total of 20; you can go past it by filling the next heart. There are five
   familiarity hearts, hence the maximum is a stat boost of 50. Boosting the
   hearts is also done by feeding familiars treats.

   There are various treat types, as well as stronger versions of a type which
   grant double the regular boost. Each familiar has a favorite treat. Feeding
   it that specific type will double the familiarity bonus it receives. You can
   know when a familiar likes a treat when pink hearts appear above their head
   when eating.

 • Catching Familiars - Once Esther joins your ranks and you've finished the
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   Temple of Trials, it becomes possible to catch new
   familiars. This is done by whacking monsters as usual, but sometimes -
   depending on the creature there's roughly a 4-25% chance that this happens -
   a bunch of pink hearts will appear above the creature, indicating it's
   fallen in love with you and is ready to be seduced. Immediately stop
   attacking it and have Esther perform the Serenade to catch it.

 • A Genius knows all Genuses - Each familiar belongs to a genus, of which there
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   are 14 in total. Each genus has their own
   typical strengths and weaknesses, and are most compatible with one of your
   main characters. Below is an overview of basic genus information.

 • Familiar Growth - Each familiar has a specific growth pattern, kind of like
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   us humans in some respects. There are three patterns of
   growth: 1. Early; 2. Normal; 3. Late. A familiar with an early growth pattern
   will excel between levels 1-40, slow down at that point between levels 40-60,
   and perform significantly below average between levels beyond that (60-99).
   A familiar with an average growth pattern will show a steady grow, but even
   though they're stronger at later levels than early risers, they're still
   worse than late bloomers. Late Bloomers will perform below average until
   approximately level 80, at which point their stats skyrocket upwards, leaving
   everyone else behind.

   As one might've guessed, early risers are particularly good in the beginning
   of the game, average growers are useful for beginning/mid-game, while late
   bloomers are especially useful when you're ready to max out your party and
   do all optional quests in the game.

 • Familiar Metamorphosis - Each familiar has a family (what's in a name) and
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   has the potential to metamorphose into a different
   form. Yes, it's Pokemonesque, but the system isn't entirely the same either.

   Each familiar can transform into a second form, which is always the same.
   But the next metamorphosis, to the third (and final) form depends on your
   choice out of two possible transformations. The most salient differences
   between these last two forms are elemental differences, growth pattern and
   types of tricks. Detailed information on all this will be of later concern.

   Familiars typically transform for the first time somewhere between level 10
   and 20. The next metamorphosis is normally possible some 10-15 levels later.
   For the first metamorphosis, your familiar needs to be fed a sign-compatible
   drop, for example, a star familiar requires a star drop. The transformation
   to its last form requires a more powerful type of the same drop.

   It's very important to realize that a metamorphosis also bumps your
   familiar's level back to 1. Admittedly, high-level familiars that transform
   into a second or third form do have somewhat higher stats (around 10-20
   points, give or take), which makes the question simple: do you want your
   specific familiar to be strong early in the game, or late in the game.
   Depending on where you are at, and also depending on the familiar's growth
   pattern, you'll want to choose wisely. Early in the game it's best to
   transform familiars as soon as possible, but you should never do this to ALL
   of them at once, or you'll be stuck with a team of fairly weak level 1
   critters; cute, yet useless. It's better to keep at least one high-level
   familiar as your primary member while having two other 'active' members that
   can profit from the experience gains as well.

MOTORVILLE [WLK-1.1]
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
ITEMS: [ ] Oliver's Clothes, [ ] Fairy Suit, [ ] The Wizard's Companion,
¯¯¯¯¯¯ [ ] Old Stick

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

You'll start in Motorville with a tutorial on moving; run over to Philip and
talk to him to proceed. Afterward, you'll be introduced to the mini map and
local map as well, so use them to locate the yellow star on the map: Oliver's
house, which is to the south and west of your current location.

Watch the scenes here, then you'll regain control at night. You'll be given a
quick tutorial on the Main Menu, as well as saving your game, so go ahead and go
to the Main Menu, then press START to save! Easy enough!

NOTE: You begin with [OLIVER'S CLOTHES] and a [FAIRY SUIT] in your Important
¯¯¯¯¯ Items of your bag.

Leave the house and make your way to Phil's garage, as marked on your mini map.
Watch the scene on the way there, then make sure the coast is clear to your
west and south before triggering another very long set of scenes. After those
are finally out of the way, you'll regain control inside your house.

Head downstairs and check out the fireplace, where you'll uncover the mighty
tome, [THE WIZARD'S COMPANION]! Go ahead and put your name (or anything else you
like) inside of it, then it's off to find something brown and sticky--like a
stick--to substitute for a magic wand!

NOTE: With The Wizard's Companion now in hand, you'll be able to collect
¯¯¯¯¯ different pages from all around the world to put inside of it. They'll
      help you along your journey, anywhere from spells to bestiary entries
      to just fun little stories.

Drippy will be your destination/guide, so follow him around for a couple of
stops, talking to him whenever he stops leading you. Along the way, you'll learn
more about the Bottomless Bag that will contain all of the items you come across
in your journey. Afterward, make your way east for another short scene, where
you'll then have to talk to the green-haired girl from earlier. Thanks to her,
you'll then obtain the [OLD STICK] you need!

You now need an open space to cast the Gateway spell, so make your way north,
east, and north to the town square. Here, your Spells menu will automatically
pop up (in the future, you need only press the SQUARE button to open it,) so go
ahead and choose 'Gateway' to set up a gate to the other world!

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
As soon as you arrive in the other world, you'll have to take on a Ruff! Don't
worry, Drippy will make sure you don't become puppy chow; follow the tutorial,
and you'll do fine.

NOTE: After the scene here, you'll automatically get the "Out of this World"
¯¯¯¯¯ trophy for making it to the other world.

When you regain control, you'll be given [WHITE BREAD x3] by Drippy. Now, there
are quite a few items that can be had here on the World Map... However, let us
make a quick stop at our destination first... after grabbing a couple of quick
treasures!

TIP: You can view the world map by pressing R1. This should help with finding
¯¯¯¯ treasures and specific locations.

IMPORTANT: An * indicates a twinkling forage point; these restore their contents
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ over time. A • indicate a unique treasure.

 * Just to the west on the hill you are on has some twinkling stars; check them
   out for a bunch of [BOOSTER SHOOTS].

 • On the northwestern side of this hill is a skeleton and a set of three large
   bones sticking out of the ground; examine the area around the middle bone to
   find some [SUPPLE LEATHER]. (Note: On your map these bones are displayed as
   the southern-most skeleton.)

NOTE: All twinkling stars on the World Map will respawn after a set amount of
¯¯¯¯¯ time has passed. These items are marked with an asterisk (*) in the
      item listing above.

Once you have those, proceed northeast to the entrance of Ding Dong Dell. After
a quick tutorial on changing your viewpoint, enter the castle. Your visit inside
is extremely short; after just one scene, head back out on the World Map. Your
new destination is now the Deep Dark Wood to the far north.

Now it's time to gather the rest of the treasure!

 * Directly southeast of Ding Dong Dell, along the eastern mountains, is another
   set of twinkling stars; examine these to get a [PLAINSWORT FLOWER].

 • Just to the south-southwest of those stars is a hill in the shape of an 'S',
   with a small forest in the top hook (on the lower plains); search this
   forest for [PIE x2].

 * Just to the northeast of Ding Dong Dell is a very small pond with a waterfall
   letting out to the south. On the eastern side of it are some twinkling stars;
   examine them to receive some [SPRINGWATER].

 • On the western side of that small pond check the waterfall to find a
   [SOUR SUNDAE].

 • Just northeast of the small pond is a chasm with a body of water at the
   bottom, and there are two sets of woods just to the east of them, but up on
   a higher level. Examine the lone tree on the southwest part of the northern
   woods to find [CHOCOLATE x2].

 • On the western side of the lake surrounding the city is a small peninsula;
   search nearby the waterfall to find a [WOODEN SWORD].

 * To the far west of Ding Dong Dell, tucked away in the southwestern corner
   below a body of water, is a small set of trees with some twinkling stars;
   examine the stars to receive another bunch of [BOOSTER SHOOTS].

 • Just to the northeast of those stars is a skeleton beside a hill; search the
   nearby (eastern) edge on the top of this hill to find [WHITE BREAD x3].

 • Look at your local map; to the northwest of Ding Dong Dell is a set of two
   bones sticking out of the ground just to the right of a hill. (It's just
   south of what looks like a giant rib cage near a river.) Make your way to
   those bones, and you'll see that there are actually three of them; check the
   ground there to find [CAKE x2].

 * Directly east/northeast from these bones, alongside the eastern mountains,
   you'll see some more twinkling stars; examine these, and you'll receive
   another [PLAINSWORT FLOWER].

 • To the far north from here, you'll see the river dumping into a lake; if you
   check the very topmost southeastern side of it beside the trees, you'll find
   a [GIANT'S TOOTH] accessory.

 * Head south and follow the river stream west. When it ends in a large pond
   with high mountains nearby, check the northern side of the river to spot
   twinkling stars. These ones will give you a [SPRINGWATER].

 • From the southern side of the river, go west, then north past the pond/lake
   onto the northern side of it to get under a rock formation, high above the
   water; check the eastern side of the trees - between the pillar and rock wall
   - to find a [WELL-WORN SWORD].

 • To the west is a bridge; cross it, then check where the brook meets the edge
   of the trees near the waterfall to find some [SUPPLE LEATHER].

 • Northwest of here, look for a set of three large singular bones sticking out
   of the ground. Check the ground to find a bottle of [ICED COFFEE].

Once you have all of these treasures, feel free to battle monsters for a while
if you please. Otherwise, you're ready to enter the Deep Dark Wood!

As you enter, you'll learn about waystones, which will not only recover your
HP and MP upon examining it, but it will also allow you to save your game. There
is also a plate on the ground next to it, but we can't do anything with it yet.
Save, then follow Drippy to the northeast and continue down the trail past
the fork to meet Old Father Oak!

During the scene you'll receive the page [FORM FAMILIAR] for your Wizard's
Companion, which will now allow you to summon familiars to do your bidding! With
that, your Spell Menu will open. Cast 'Form Familiar' and the Mite will join
your party as Oliver's first familiar. In addition to that, Old Father Oak will
also give you the [HEALING TOUCH] spell, as well as the [FIREBALL] spell for
your Wizard's Companion. Immediately cast it on the fellow and watch him wither
away.. No, you're actually not allowed to do that, but surely the thought
crossed your mind.

With new abilities comes a new tutorial battle, so follow along carefully and
wipe out the Teeny Boppers with your new familiar. After the fight, learn more
about taking care of and upgrading your familiars, then go ahead and equip the
Mite with the Well-Worn Sword you found out on the World Map. While you are at
it, give Oliver the Giant's Tooth accessory that you found.

When you're ready, head back south to the fork that you passed and head down
the right/northeastern path, opening the first chest you see for a loaf of
[WHITE BREAD]. Simply follow the path into the next area, the Whispering
Waterfalls.

Use the Waystone along the way to recover your HP and MP and save. Keep
following the path, and after jumping across some stones in the river, you'll
come to a second chest that's just to your right. Open it to find a bar of
[CHOCOLATE], then continue on, battling beasties along the way.

You'll soon come to another fork; ignore the path to the southwest (it contains
a sealed chest that we can't open yet, so we'll come back to it later,) and
instead, jump across the rocks to the southeast (initially your left). You'll
get another quick tutorial on assigning new tricks to familiars; continue down
the path afterwards and keep your eyes open for a chest to your left/southwest
with another loaf of [WHITE BREAD] inside.

Take a few steps back to the fork, then head southeast. Continue along the path
until you come to a tree stump; there's another chest at its base, so open it
for a bottle of [ICED COFFEE]. That's it for treasures here! You're currently at
a fork, but going east will take you back to where you opened the last chest, so
continue west instead to reach another Waystone. Make sure to save!

When you're ready, take a few steps south, where you'll encounter the giant
Guardian of the Woods! Yikes!

  STATS:   152 HP, Weak against: Fire, Resists: Storm

  ATTACKS: 1. Physical Attack [Single Target, Minor Damage]
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ 2. Windfall [Single Target, Medium Damage, Use Defend!]

  REWARDS: 90 EXP, 75 G, Spirit of the Woods

Even though you can use the Mite to fight for you, it is recommended staying as
Oliver; his Fireball spell will do more damage much more quickly than the little
familiar can dish out.

In fact, all you'll need to do is spam your Fireball spell against the big lug
by choosing Spells, then Fireball. When you get low on MP, be sure to look for
any blue glims on the battlefield, but stay far away from the Guardian otherwise
to minimize threats.

When the Guardian prepares for its Windfall attack you'll be warned to Defend in
order to minimize damage. Once you defend against this attack twice, you'll be
told that you have a Chance to do some major damage, so when that happens,
CANCEL your defense with CIRCLE and quickly nail him with another Fireball.

He will also use the Bellow spell; this doesn't do any damage, but it will stun
you to where you can't do anything, and he will usually follow it up with
Windfall, so be sure to defend against it so you can avoid the status effect.

If Oliver drops below 20 HP, be sure to cast your Healing Touch spell to
rejuvenate yourself (or even use some White Bread, if you prefer not to spend
your MP.) Should you run out of MP completely, and Iced Coffee might just help
you get through the fight, although it normally shouldn't be necessary.

As the battle nears its end, you'll be told of a 'gold glim' that appears; once
you see one of these beauties on the field, be sure to run over and quickly
grab it! It'll restore all of your HP, and it will also allow you to perform a
Miracle Move that doesn't use any MP! Once you get this one, perform that move
and end this battle with a bang!

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

After the battle, you'll automatically receive the page [THE GUARDIAN OF THE
WOODS], as well as [THE SECOND TALE] of Wonder.

NOTE: After defeating the Guardian of the Woods, you'll receive the
¯¯¯¯¯ "En Guardian!" trophy.

After the battle and upon your return to Old Father Oak, you'll be able to
access the Telling Stone from the menu. You'll receive a [LOCKET] from him,
as well as the [TAKE HEART] and [GIVE HEART] spells.

Once you regain control, make your way to the exit and head back out to the
World Map. Next stop: Ding Dong Dell!

Once you enter the city and watch the scene, talk to the active doorman, and
he'll let you take some of his enthusiasm! You'll automatically open your magic
menu, so choose 'Take Heart' to use it on the doorman. Once you have his
enthusiasm, approach the other doorman and talk to him; again, with your magic
menu open, choose 'Give Heart' to give him the first doorman's enthusiasm!

With that, you'll now gain access to the city after a few scenes. Start making
your way northwest, but before going through the archway, check the urn to the
left of the arch for [5 - 15 G]. Now go through the arch for a scene, where
you'll decide that you need a new outfit. Just to the north and east of where
you are is the Hootique, so stop in and talk to Hootenanny. She does have some,
but you'll have to wait til the morning before you can get it, so now's the time
to check out elsewhere.

First stop will be Swift Solutions; it's to your south and west. Inside, you'll
learn about different tasks that you can take on, as well as different bounty
hunts that you can partake. You'll then receive a Merit Stamp Cards from the
taskmaster; fill them up, and you can exchange them for rewards at any Swift
Solutions location! With that, you can now access your own Journal to see how
you're progressing in the story, as well as check out your various side tasks.
Check out the errand board for new errands and inquire about bounties at the
taskmaster.

NOTE: Whenever new tasks or bounties appear, and they are able to be (easily)
¯¯¯¯¯ completed, we will suggest completing them via the Errands / Bounties
      box, as seen below. For completion's sake, we recommend doing them as
      they're listed in the walkthrough.

| To begin this errand, talk to the grimalkin (cat-lady) in the center of the  |
| first area of Ding Dong Dell, on the northern bridge connecting the eastern  |
| and western sides. She'll ask you to retrieve two Springwaters and two       |
| Plainswort Flowers.                                                          |

| If you already pillaged all of the treasures from the World Map in the Ding  |
| Dong Dell area once, you should have both sets of items, but if not, you'll  |
| need to visit the areas with twinkling stars on the World Map to obtain      |
| these.                                                                       |

| • Directly southeast of Ding Dong Dell, along the eastern mountains, is      |
|   another set of twinkling stars; examine these to get a [PLAINSWORT FLOWER].|
|                                                                              |
| • Just to the northeast of Ding Dong Dell is a very small pond with a        |
|   waterfall letting out to the south. On the eastern side of it are some     |
|   twinkling stars; examine them to receive some [SPRINGWATER].               |
|                                                                              |
| • North of Ding Dong Dell, alongside the eastern mountains, but south of the |
|   northernmost lake, you'll see some more twinkling stars; examine these,    |
|   and you'll receive another [PLAINSWORT FLOWER].                            |
|                                                                              |
| • From that last flower, head west along the nearby river that starts at the |
|   northernmost lake, but ends in a pond to the west. Before it ends into     |
|   another pond/lake, check on the northern side of the river to see some     |
|   more twinkling stars. These ones will give you another [SPRINGWATER].      |
|                                                                              |

| DESCRIPTION: A gruffian keeps stealing produce from farmers' fields outside  |
| ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ of town. It has to be dealt with quickly--it's nearly harvest   |
|              time!                                                           |

| Being the first Bounty Hunt, it's extremely easy. Just leave Ding Dong Dell, |
| then head southeast; you'll see a blue marker on the map indicating your     |
| target on the beach. Just chase down and encounter the Gruffian, then take   |
| him out.                                                                     |

| Mite won't have enough stamina to take them all out at once, so focus on     |
| getting rid of the weaker Ruffs first, then switch back to Oliver and start  |
| blasting the Gruffian with Fireball. Once Mite has all of his stamina back,  |
| make sure your HP is at an acceptable level, then send him back out to slice |
| and dice the Gruffian until he falls as well.                                |
|                                                                              |
| To earn your Reward and Stamps as shown above, return to Swift Solutions     |
| and claim your prize.                                                        |
|______________________________________________________________________________|


When you're done with the optional errands and bounties, feel free to explore
the town a little and proceed with the main storyline.

On the southern side of the Swift Solutions building is a twinkling urn with [10
G], so grab it, then head south and hug the wall as you go southeast. You should
find another twinkling urn; examine it for some [ICE CREAM]. Next, head (north)
east from Swift Solutions and head through the gate. When you see the road widen
just a bit on both sides, check the northern side for yet another twinkling urn,
this time with a loaf of [WHITE BREAD].

To your east is the Cawtermaster's Store; head inside first and open the chest
there for a [SUNDAE], then return outside and check the leafy area to the
immediate south to find another chest behind a tree, this time with a bottle
of [ICED COFFEE].

Next up, head to the Cat's Cradle, which is the first building to the north
after entering the city. Examine the twinkling urn here for some [CAKE], then
talk to the purrprietor to stay overnight for a measly 10 G. By staying here,
you will also unlock a Regions of the World page, [THE SUMMERLANDS: NORTH]!

Leave the Cat's Cradle and make your way back to the Hootique, where you'll
receive a set of [TRAVELER'S CLOTHES]. Now that you look the part, you can see
the King! Proceed north to the second area of the city.

Just a few steps forward after entering, look to your right/east to find a
twinkling urn; this one has a [POISON-BE-GONE]. Head north a bit, just up the
stairs and past the fountain, then turn east and check the southeastern corner
of this area to find a chest containing a loaf of [WHITE BREAD].

Make your way further east by going through the archway to the Grave of the
Sage, then by going southeast. In the area just to the south of the actual
grave, check out the twinkling urn here for a slice of [PIE].

Next, make your way to the actual Grave of the Sage. Check behind the stone to
find a boy. He can't talk, but he'll give you the [SPIRIT MEDIUM] spell, at
which point, you'll need to turn around and cast the 'Spirit Medium' spell
itself back onto him. With it, you can now talk to him and learn more about
the boy--Horace, the Sage of Ages! You'll see him again later on.

Head back to the square and proceed north, talking to the guards here to find
out that we can't actually see the King. Why? Well, one of his aides lost his
precious red herring, so now we have to find it before we can do anything. Head
back to south Ding Dong Dell so we can start looking.

Just to the north of Swift Solutions is a dock; Drippy will spot the red
herring, so hop on the wooden poles to have Oliver spot the fish himself, only
to have it retreat back toward the palace, so get back to dry land and head back
to north Ding Dong Dell.

Go back to the Grave of the Sage, where you'll actually catch the red herring
in shallow water. With Drippy holding on to the floppy fish, run back to the
guards at the palace entrance to hand the fish over. Doing so grants you the
audience with the King, so watch the scene inside the palace before you're left
back in town with more questions than answers.

Enter the Telling Stone! He tells you that the Locket will glow when there are
people nearby with pieces of heart that you need, so when you regain control,
hop back down to south Ding Dong Dell. Your target is in the northeastern corner
of the area, just before the stairs leading down to a watery area. Talk to the
boy with the broom, then use 'Take Heart' to get his extra enthusiasm.

With that in hand, make your way back to the palace and talk to the King once
more, choosing 'Give Heart' when the Spell Menu pops up to finally bring King
Tom back to his normal self. He will reward you with his wand--once he finds
it--but in the mean time, you'll receive the [SPRING LOCK] spell and the
[REJUVENATE] spell from him.

Travel back to the south end of Ding Dong Dell. First, stop inside the Hootique
and check out the chest on the north side of the room; open your Spell Menu and
choose 'Spring Lock' to spring the chest open for a [SANDWICH]! Next, pay a
visit to the Cawtermaster's Store. You'll learn more about equipping your
familiars (which you should have already done with the Mite's weapon that we
found) and you'll also finally be able to shop. There's nothing worth grabbing
just yet (as we either already found or will soon find suitable equipment), so
leave the shop and head back to the palace to claim your prize.

As chance would have it, as the King was looking for the wand, he mysteriously
disappeared, so we have to go searching once again to figure out where he went.
Thanks to Drippy's keen brain, we'll start looking in Motorville, so open your
Spell Menu and choose Gateway to reopen the gate back to Motorville.


To Motorville
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Here, visit Leila's shop and talk to her to find out Timmy's gone missing as
well. Head over to the front of Oliver's house to meet the green-haired girl
once again; she'll finally introduce herself as Pea, and she'll lead you to
Timmy. Follow her as she leads you around in a roundabout way to the south end
of town to the striped feline. Drippy will load the cat onto his back, so lead
the way back to Leila's to help him out.

With Timmy back in Leila's arms and another clue in hand, return to the street
and cast Gateway to return to Ding Dong Dell.


Back to Ding Dong Dell
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Go back to the northeastern part of the first area of Ding Dong Dell to where
you got the enthusiasm from Tommy; talking to him will reveal that King Tom is
actually down in the well! He wants to go with you, but since Drippy refuses to
let him, he'll give you the familiar that was following him around instead! You
now have two familiars; the Mite and the Thumbelemur!

You'll get another lecture on familiar's abilities here, as your new one can
cancel enemy attacks. When you regain control, proceed north to the entrance of
the Ding Dong Well. Examine it for a quick tip from Drippy, then open your Spell
Menu and choose 'Spring Lock' to open the gate! Off to the well we go!


DING DONG WELL - WHERE A PUSSYCAT ONCE FELL... [WLK-1.5]
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
ITEMS: [ ] Iced Coffee, [ ] Poison-Be-Gone, [ ] Iced Coffee, [ ] Spiral Horn
¯¯¯¯¯¯
PAGES: [ ] 62 (Frostbite)
¯¯¯¯¯¯
ENEMIES: Rabbot, Taddlywink, Naja, Danglerfish, Bubbud, Hickory Dock (*)
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Head north a bit to fight a battle with a very short tutorial on switching
familiars. Afterward, take the eastern path at the fork here, turning north to
another branching path. Head east first - through the shallow water - opening
the chest at the dead-end here for a bottle of [ICED COFFEE]. Go back and
continue west, turning north at your next opportunity to come to another split.

Move west and north first to find another chest; get the [POISON-BE-GONE] out of
here, then return and head east, then north. Examine the large door here to open
it, where you'll find a large statue of King Tom with three unlit torches.
Approach each one and open your Spell Menu, then select Fireball. Do this
QUICKLY for each one, and the door to your north will open for you.

After going through it, you'll be at yet another fork. Run west, then north from
this one to another treasure-filled dead-end with another bottle of [ICED
COFFEE]. Make your way east now, and when the path turns south after you have
gone in the water, check behind the stairs and in the water to find a blue
chest. Use your Spring Lock spell on it to get a [SPIRAL HORN], which you should
immediately equip to your new Thumbelemur!

Keep moving east and you'll come to another unlit torch. DON'T light this one
just yet though; there are three to light like last time, but they're spread
around now. From this torch, head south and leap across the stones, then turn
east and light this torch with your Fireball spell. Now, QUICKLY head north,
lighting the one you come to here, then just as quickly jump down the stones to
your west to light the one we originally skipped. This is the shortest path; if
you were quick enough, the gate to your north will open. If not, then try it
again!

Proceed north down a long set of stairs, following the path as it turns west,
then north to come to another fork; take the northern path first, leading to a
dead-end with two chests. To the west is a [SANDWICH], and to the east is a
locked purple chest that we can't open just yet. Head back to the last fork and
continue east to one last intersection.

There's nothing we can do (yet) to the south, but you might want to take note of
the green chest there. In any case head north to arrive at a Waystone. Be sure
to recover and save, and when you're ready, proceed north to find King Tom,
along with a very interesting, beastly rodent!

| BOSS FIGHT: HICKORY DOCK |
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  STATS:   365 HP, Weak against: Fire, Resists: ---
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯
  ATTACKS: 1. Physical Attack [Single Target, Minor Damage]
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ 2. Mousefire [Single Target, Medium Damage, Use Defend!]
           3. Tailspin [Single Target, Confusion Effect, Switch to Thumbelemur!]

  REWARDS: 125 EXP, 100 G
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Start off the battle as Oliver, throwing Fireballs at the rodent while keeping
your distance until you get a feel for his moves. As long as you're on the move,
his physical attacks won't even touch you. Once you think you know his moves
well enough, switch to your Thumbelemur and go on an all-out physical assault
against Hickory.

His Mousefire attack is pretty quick and strong at the same time, so if you are
quick enough, try to Defend against it; otherwise, just grin and bear it, using
Healing Touch as necessary. However, sometimes his spell won't work, and it'll
actually blow back in the giant mouse's face, giving you a free shot! Dash in
there with your Thumbelemur and let loose a good chain of attacks.

His third move, Tailspin, can cause confusion to your familiars, but as Drippy
will tell you, your Thumbelemur isn't easily confused, so as soon as you see it
coming, be sure to switch to him to avoid getting nailed with that nasty effect.

As long as you occasionally switch to Oliver to heal up your HP and cast the
occasional Fireball to give your Thumbelemur some rest, your new familiar should
be able to take on the giant rodent practically on his own.

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

After the battle, you'll have to watch another set of scenes before you're
back in the palace, where you'll finally receive the [MAGIC WAND] from the King,
as well as the [FROSTBITE] spell. Sweet! Before continuing on with the
journey, we have some new Errands and Bounties!

| To begin this errand, you must first find this mysterious forest. Take a     |
| look at your map; directly to the east of Ding Dong Dell is a path between   |
| two mountain ranges, with a forest right in the middle of that path. Just to |
| the north of THAT forest is the one we need to visit, so head east to the    |
| smaller forest, then north of it to arrive inside.                           |
|                                                                              |
| Once you're in the forest, approach the blue chest to the northwest and use  |
| your 'Spring Lock' spell to obtain a [BATTLER'S BADGE] accessory. Feel free  |
| to equip it, then talk to the boy beside the chest. He'll tell you that five |
| Rhinobores are destroying their homes, so you'll be the one to slay the      |
| beasts.                                                                      |

| Back out on the World Map, you'll see all five of them surrounding various   |
| parts of the forest. They are actually pretty easy; just go into battle and  |
| let your Thumbelemur have a sparring session with each one to quickly knock  |
| them out.                                                                    |

| Once they're down, return to the forest and talk to the boy again to receive |
| your reward: [ICED COFFEE x3} and [50 G]!                                    |

|______________________________________________________________________________|


There's something else to do before departing. Depending on whom you received
your Enthusiasm from, one more person should be left with some of it. Check both
south and north Ding Dong Dell for a glowing green dot and talk to that person
to get a bit of Enthusiasm for the road (with the 'Take Heart' spell, as you
know by now).

Before continuing on with the story, we also have one more chest that we can
open now that we couldn't earlier, and we need to tell Old Father Oak our
progress, so from the World Map, make your way to the far north and re-enter
The Deep Dark Wood.


THE DEEP DARK WOOD

First off, go ahead and make your way all the way north to Old Father Oak, who
will give you [MILK CHOCOLATE x5] to reward your growing familiars.

Now is an excellent time to give your familiars some treats. The Milk Chocolate
bars will increase their attack, and by now you should have plenty of other
treats for both Mite and Thumbelemur. You don't have to spend all your treats
at once (and probably can't anyway), but it's worth your while to at least give
them some of it.

Head back to the fork and go northeast, following the path for a long while
until you come to the fork just after jumping over the rocks in the stream. To
your southwest is that blue chest that we had to skip earlier, so make your way
up to it now and choose 'Spring Lock' from your Spell Menu to open it and obtain
a [CREAMY FLAN].

That's all you can do here right now, so let's get back to the story. Make your
way back to the entrance and head out to the World Map. Our destination is the
Golden Grove to the far southwest of the map, so make the long trek there.

After a short scene, use the Waystone if you like, then make your way south.
There's a chest to the west at the fork, so be sure to open it for a [SANDWICH].
Follow the path east around the curve and keep heading east until you reach
several mushrooms that serve as stepping stones. Drippy gives you the go ahead
to just jump on them, so hop across them to the north to land at a fork. To the
north and west is an accessory that boosts attack, so be sure to head over there
and get the [BEAST FANGS] out of the chest. (Make note of the robot while you're
here.)

Head back to the fork and continue east, following the path as it turns south.
The mushrooms to your east only lead to a dead end, so head past them and you'll
eventually come to a rather large four-way fork. First off, take the eastern
path and follow it to a dead-end to get another [SANDWICH] against a tree, then
return and take the southern path for an [ICED COFFEE] at the dead-end there.

Just to the west is another fork; north leads to a dead-end, so head west first,
turning north at the clearing to find a blue chest. Use your 'Spring Lock' spell
on it, and you'll receive a [HOARFROST HARPOON]! Don't have any use for it yet,
but it'll be of use soon!

Continue further south and west to a dead-end... However, if you take a look at
the tree here, you'll find a familiar egg! After a bit of an explanation about
the eggs and life force, open your Spell Menu and cast 'Rejuvenate' on the
withered tree to restore it to its former glory. Watch the events unfold, then
you'll regain control.

Head back east and return to the last fork, where you'll see your yellow star to
the east; go check it out, and the little Seed Sprite from before will reappear,
so follow him as he leads you back north to the mushrooms that we passed
earlier. Talk to it again in this area to receive the [QUICKEN GROWTH] spell,
and the little guy will finally join your party!

With the new Seed Sprite, you can now Evade attacks, and you'll also be given a
lesson on counterattacking. Make sure to equip the newly found Hoarfrost Harpoon
on the Seed Sprite. That should be it here here in the forest for now, so go
ahead and make your way back to the last fork and make your way south. You'll
come to some small mushrooms that you can't climb, but with that new spell, you
can make them big enough to climb! Open your Spell Menu and choose 'Quicken
Growth' and you'll be able to climb them.

Keep following along, and as the path turns east, you'll come to another
Waystone (as well as a purple chest that can't be opened yet,) so be sure to
recover and save! When you're ready, proceed east to the open area, where you'll
find a fountain, but more importantly, a rather ticked off guardian!

Much like the battle with the Guardian of the Woods, you're going to want to
have your familiars sit this one out and let Oliver do most of the work, as this
guy hits HARD. That, and it's really tricky to get physical attacks in on this
guy while avoiding taking damage. For Oliver, Frostbite will be your best bet,
as it does more damage per MP than your Fireball would.

Both the Gladiataur's physical attacks and his Savage Swipe are really easy to
avoid; stay on the move and keep your distance. The Savage Swipe basically gets
thrown at you from the end of his sword, so just stepping to the left or right
will cause it to miss. Be careful, however; if it does hit, say goodbye to at
least 1/3 of your HP.

His last attack with his sword is the only one that's potentially worrisome;
Everblade. No matter where you are on the field, you'll still get hit by it
for quite a large amount of damage, so be sure to Defend against this attack.

As the battle endures, make sure you keep your HP and MP up, ESPECIALLY your HP.
Certainly don't let it fall below 50, or it might cost you. If you get low on
health, swap out your Seed Sprite and use Drowsy Drops to send Gladiataur to
dreamland. Be sure to swap back to Oliver at this point to heal yourself up.

After dropping about half of his HP, Gladiataur loses his mind and throws his
sword and shield away. He may seem upset, but now he's really easy to manage
because he no longer uses anything except physical attacks. From here, just keep
casting Frostbite.

However, once you've gotten Gladiataur down to 30% of his HP, he gets REALLY
ticked! He will now use his Headlong Rush attack, which is even stronger than
his Everblade. He'll only use it the one time, then Drippy will grab his shield
and knock him silly with it, giving you a chance to get some attacks in. Quickly
switch to Thumbelemur and rush him in there to get some melee attacks in before
he regains his composure. It might just be enough to finish him off.
Alternatively, look for a golden glim to perform a finishing move.

If that doesn't work, quickly switch to Oliver and fire off Frostbite spells as
fast as you can before he starts using his Rampage attack; it's the same as
Headlong Rush, but even stronger, it doesn't miss, and can easily take off half
of your HP. If you see it coming, use the Defend command immediately.

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

After the battle, you'll receive the [GLADIATAUR] page. Face the spring, then
open your Spell Menu and cast 'Rejuvenate' to bring the spring back to life. In
addition to it coming back, you'll receive the [THE EIGHTH TALE] of Wonder for
your Wizard's Companion.

Once you have those, head south to be back out onto the World Map, but this
time, in the Shimmering Sands!

As with the Rolling Hills area, we have quite a few treasures that we can grab
out here in the Shimmering Sands. However... it's going to be a bit of a
struggle to traverse this area to collect them all right now, as even Drippy
will tell you that the monsters here are a bit stronger than we're used to.

It's normally a good idea to do all optional things as soon as possible, but for
this area it's advisable and safest to wait with a grand exploration until
you're better prepared. There are nonetheless a few items that aren't too far
out of your way to Al Mamoon. Just make sure you're fully healed all the time,
and if possible avoid (or sneak up on) enemies.

 * Just to the northwest of the entrance to the Golden Grove are some twinkling
   stars up on a hill; examine these for a [GLOWCAP].

 • Travel even further west of the Golden Grove near the ocean; search the
   edge of the land that sticks out most into the water to find a [SPIRAL HORN].

 • Move southeast until you come to the entrance of the desert. From there, you
   should see a rocky valley split off to the northeast; go to the dead-end
   there and search the crevice on the far left side to find [GLOWCAP x2].

 * Further south of the entrance of the desert (and south of some quicksand) is
   another set of twinkling stars near a large stone and some cactii; examine
   them for a [BANEFLOWER].

 • To the far south of the rock you are at now is a set of two large rocks; a
   larger one on the left, and a smaller one on the right. Make your way to that
   small rock on the right, and you'll find [100 G] if you examine the right
   side of it.

More exploration will follow later. For now, head to Al Mamoon in the center of
the desert.

Watch the scene as you enter, then you'll have to start your search for Rashad.
First, check near the entrance on the other side of the area on your right; you
should see a chest sitting near the "window" of sorts with [WHITE BREAD x3].
Further to the right, you'll see a twinkling urn; examine it for another loaf of
[WHITE BREAD].

Go inside the Cat's Cradle (the inn) while you're on this side of town and check
around inside. Just to the right of the purrprietor is another twinkling urn
with a [SALTED ICE CREAM], as well as a locked blue chest. Use 'Spring Lock' and
grab the cup of [STRONG COFFEE] out of it. While you're here, go ahead and spend
the 20 G to rest up (and recover all of your HP and MP). You'll receive another
page for your Wizard's companion: [THE SUMMERLANDS: SOUTH]! Head back out into
the town.

Head west to be back out in front of the Cawtermaster's Store. There aren't any
treasures inside of the store, but there's another twinkling urn just to the
left of the entrance and down the stairs that has [10 - 20 G] inside! Head down
the road here and visit the Hootique to your left. There's a chest just to the
right of the Hootenanny, so make sure to get the [SANDWICH] out of it before you
head back outside.

Go right *past* your destination first to collect a few more treasures. Against
the wall to the right of the your destination tucked away in the corner is
another twinkling urn, so grab the [BLINDNESS-BE-GONE] out of it, then make your
way north to a rather large town square.

Take a moment to stand at the entrance to the big area and look around; you
should see a chest very close to you to your west, an urn against the far
western wall;, another urn to the north of the fountain on your left, and one
last urn to the southeast of the fountain to your right (which you probably
can't actually see.) Start with the chest for [50 G], then make your way
clockwise from the western urn to get a [SOUR SUNDAE], a loaf of [WHITE BREAD],
and a [POISON-BE-GONE].

While you're in this area, make a note that Horace the Sage is by the fountain
to the right; use your 'Spirit Medium' spell to talk to him, and he'll give you
[THE FIRST TALE] of Wonder for your Wizard's Companion. Go ahead and read it
really quick by taking a look at it in your menu, then talk to Horace again to
have him give you a riddle. He'll ask you who the third smallest of the
characters were; the answer is 'DRAGON OF THE WEST', so type that all out to
receive the [DRAW POISON] spell from him.

There are some Errands and Bounties we can partake in, but for now, hold off on
them and continue the story just a bit further. Go to your destination and talk
to Rashaad to learn about his daughter. To proceed any further, you'll need to
return to Motorville and find her soul mate, so go ahead and cast 'Gateway' and
head back to your world!


To Motorville
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Head straight down to your destination to spot the girl, Myrtle, then make your
way to her house for a scene. Use the 'Spring Lock' spell on her door as Drippy
suggested... but it won't make any difference. Start making your way west, and
you'll run into Pea once again, so run back to Myrtle's house and talk to her.
She says that you need to go inside, so check the door again, and it'll be
unlocked!

Watch the scenes inside, then make your way to Rusty's shop to try to straighten
things out. Heed Drippy's warning before going in and make sure that your HP
and MP levels are decent. Also save while you're at it. When you're ready, head
inside. Rather than a calm meeting with Myrtle's father, you're treated to a
full on assault from a Nightmare!

Nightmare's physical attacks may seem somewhat harmless, but it's easy to get
caught in a flurry of them that will quickly drain your HP, so stay away from
him as much as possible. He's slightly faster than you are, but it matters not,
since his physical attack is initiated rather slowly. Foul Fumes is easy to
avoid as well, as long as you keep your distance; just make sure that you don't
step on the purple bubbles left over even after the spell is done, or you'll
still take damage and become poisoned.

Hard Heart, on the other hand, does a decent amount of damage once it lands, and
it will cause you to be Blinded, so be sure to quickly Defend once you see it
coming. As long as you're playing Oliver, being Blind won't make a bit of
difference, since you can still cast your spells with no problem.

Only when you run out of MP and with no blue glims available, use an Iced
Coffee, but only drink those precious cups sparingly.

After the battle you'll learn a bit more about Nightmares before deciding to
find a piece of heart to help; this time, we need some kindness. Luckily, it's
sitting right in front of you, so talk to his wife, then choose 'Take Heart',
followed by talking to Rusty and choosing 'Give Heart' and kindness to restore
him back to normal.

Head over to Myrtle's house once again to give her the good news. Watch the
heartwarming events inside the house, and you'll eventually regain control back
outside, ready to take some of Myrtle's newfound courage! Use 'Take Heart' to
get and store some courage in your Locket.

After you have that, go ahead and cast 'Gateway' to retrun to Al Mamoon.


Back to Al Mamoon
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Make your way back to Rashaad's stand and talk to his daughter, choosing 'Give
Heart' (courage) to return her back to normal as well! Some more scenes will
play, telling you about the Clarion among other things, and both Rashaad and his
daughter, Esther, will decide to help you in your fight. What makes it even
better is that Esther wants to help directly, and she will join your party as
your second full-time party member! Along with her will also come her very own
familiar, a Drongo! You'll also get [ESTHER'S CLOTHES] by default.

Of course, Rashaad will fulfill the need of what you originally came to him for:
spells. He'll give you the [PUPPET STRING], [SECRET INGREDIENT], [MAGIC LAMP],
and [PULSE] spell pages for your Magician's Companion! Sweet!


AL MAMOON - BOUNTIES AND ERRANDS [WLK-2.3]
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
To continue on, we will now need to go through the Trials of the sages at the
Temple of Trials. Rashaad will accompany you to the Temple, and you will regain
control. Before we go, there is plenty to do, and we need to prepare ourselves
as well!

Start off by visiting the Cawtermaster's Store. You should have accumulated
quite a few Guilders by now for some shopping, so let's get some equipment.
Don't worry about getting a Bone Sword or Leather Shield for your Mite, nor a
Robe for Esther's Drongo; we'll be getting better equipment through Errands and
Bounties for those. For everyone/everything else though, go ahead and go all
out, upgrading them to the best available equipment right now. A Flint Spear is
a good investment for Esther's familiar, and the accessories give minor stat
boosts, although they're not quite necessary either.

Our next stop will keep us quite busy for a while; Swift Solutions. There is a
TON to do before moving on! Check the Errand Board to learn of the tasks there,
and talk to the Taskmaster to discover new Bounty Hunts.

NOTE: As you leave the city, you'll have another tutorial from Drippy on how
¯¯¯¯¯ to fight together with Esther. We recommend setting your AI to where
      both of your party members attack the same target. 
      
      While you're out here Bounty Hunting and running Errands, you may
      want to reference the next section below regarding the World Map of this
      area, so you can gather treasure while you are traversing various areas
      of the map.

| To begin this errand, you need to talk to the woman who is just a bit south  |
| of the left milk fountain at the north end of town. Accept her task, and     |
| she'll give you the [LOVERS' LUNCH BASKET] to take to her husband, who       |
| happens to be in the Golden Grove. Go ahead and head back out to the World   |

| Of course, as chance would have it, the husband is quite a ways in the       |

| monsters have taken a special liking to you since you have that yummy basket |

| To begin this errand, you need to talk to the merchant lady walking around   |
| just below the two milk fountains in the northern part of Al Mamoon. She's   |
| been having problems with Boneheads, so it's up to us to take care of the    |
| problem.                                                                     |

| Out on the World Map, you'll actually have to seek out and destroy 10        |
| Boneheads. They aren't pointed out to you in any way, so just start wandering|
| around and looking for them. Now would probably be a good time to do some    |
| treasure hunting, taking the bony buggers out as you come across them. (See  |
| the next section for locations.)                                             |

| Once you've defeated the tenth one, return to Al Mamoon and talk to the      |
| merchant lady again to receive your REWARD: a [BONE SWORD] and [200 G]!      |

| NOTE: This errand cannot be fully complete until you've went to the Temple   |
| ¯¯¯¯¯ of Trials. However, it consists out of various other errands which you |
|       might want to do at this time anyway.                                  |
|                                                                              |
| To begin this errand, you need to talk to the guy manning the curry stall    |
| just to the right of the eastern milk fountain. He needs some ingredients    |
| for his ultimate dish, so you'll need to find them for him. Required are:    |
| Fluffy Rice, some Tender Beef, and a pinch of the Sheikh's special spices!   |
| Make sure to have some extra time allotted for this one, because it'll take  |
| a while (and it spans three actual tasks).                                   |
|                                                                              |
| First, stop at Rashaad's stand and talk to the woman just below it; she has  |
| some extra enthusiasm, so be sure to grab it with 'Take Heart'. [Or, if you  |
| had already gotten her enthusiasm for a previous errand, you'll have to      |
| backtrack to Ding Dong Dell for it.]                                         |
|                                                                              |
| Next, check your inventory; if you already have a Tender Beef and Fluffy     |
| Rice, then you're fine. If not, then stop in at the Hootique and buy one of  |
| each.                                                                        |
|                                                                              |
| Now head over to Swift Solutions, where a new blue dot has appeared on your  |
| map. This is the Sheikh you heard of, but he's brokenhearted and needs help. |
| Go ahead and accept Errand #003, then turn right around and hand over the    |
| enthusiasm with 'Give Heart' to return him to normal. As a thank you, you'll |
| receive [SANDWICH x2] and [100 G], effectively ending Errand #003.           |
|                                                                              |
| Now that he's back to normal, he will agree to give you some of his spices,  |
| but only if you bring him what he needs, which is a turmeric root and three  |
| generous pinches of spicy seeds. Off to find those as well!                  |
|                                                                              |
| Unfortunately, none of what he wants is actually in the city, so we need to  |
| find a way to get them. Stop in at Swift Solutions first and talk to the     |
| Taskmaster. A new Bounty Hunt has opened up, so go ahead and accept the job  |
| to start Bounty #088!                                                        |
|                                                                              |
| To get our turmeric root, we must defeat the lumberwood as shown in the      |
| Bounty, and he hangs out around Golden Grove, so leave the city and make     |
| your way northwest, taking on the beast once he's in your sight. The battle  |
| itself is a cinch; just cast Pulse with Oliver 2-3 times and he's toast!     |
| Upon his defeat, he'll relinquish the [TURMERIC ROOT] that you need, as well |
| as 62 EXP and 47 G.                                                          |
|                                                                              |
| Now, the last ingredient that you need is the spicy seed, and you need       |
| three of them. The only place to find them (and this is a one-time deal) is  |
| to the west-southwest of Al Mamoon in the Smoky Moutains. Climb the path     |
| toward the volcano, and along the way, you'll come across three sets         |
| twinkling stars as you get closer to the mountain itself. The first pinch    |
| of [SPICY SEEDS] will be at the corner where the path turns west; the        |
| second pinch of [SPICY SEEDS] will be to the west near the river of lava,    |
| and the third pinch of [SPICY SEEDS] will be all the way to the west near a  |
| stream of lava. To get the third one you'll need the Bridge spell, which     |
| you aqcuire at the Temple of Trials.                                         |
|                                                                              |
| Once you have those, return to Al Mamoon. Stop in at Swift Solutions first   |
| and claim your prize, [MILK CHOCOLATE x5] and [200G], ending Bounty #088.    |
| Afterwards, head back outside and talk to the Sheikh, giving him his         |
| ingredients. With them, he makes the spices you need, and you'll receive a   |
| bowl of [SHEIKH'S SPECIAL SPICES].                                           |
|                                                                              |
| Bring all ingredients back to Raj at the town square and he'll reward you    |
| with [TIKKA MAHALA x5] and [200 G] after a scene has played. You can now     |
| also buy Tikka Mahala at any time you wish from him for the price of 200 G.  |
| It's in fact an excellent healing item early in the game since it restores   |
| 150 HP.                                                                      |

When traveling through the valley leading towards the temple, a scene triggers
and you receive a new page of The Wizard's Companion, [THE SIXTH TALE] of
Wonder. Head up to the temple when you're ready.

TIP:  There's a forage point with a piece of [SHADOWGLASS] hidden behind the
¯¯¯¯  Temple of Trials.

There aren't any enemies for you to fight in this area, at least no regular
random critters. Instead you'll have to face three separate trials to test
your worthiness as a wizard's apprentice. Simply talk to Umbopa and Solomon to
watch some scenes first.

The Test of Wits
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Head right to start this trial, in which you must solve three puzzles. You'll
have to stand on the symbol and cast the 'Puppet String' spell in order to move
the statues around, although you might want to ask the bird for a hint first,
which is, "The dragon sees the warrior's sword, while the bird is shown his
shield, the beast, meanwhile, looks to his right, and sees an empty field."
Should you not be able to figure out the solution, the order in which the
statues must be placed is, from left to right: beast, dragon, warrior, bird.

                       VIDEO: http://tinyurl.com/b87rfzl

The second puzzle requires you to move the blocks, making them blend in the
overall picture. From left to right, the first block needs to be placed in the
center of the figure's 'mouth', the next block's proper location is the left-to-
center part of the right eye, the third block should be moved to the right part
of the mouth, the fourth block fits the left eye (its right side), and the last
block fits the left part of the face's mouth.

If you're still having trouble getting these where they go, or you lose track
along the way, hopefully these tables will help.

The third puzzle is a bit more complicated than the first. Your hint? "The bird
is bound to dragon and moon, and on a star he sits. The beast links warrior,
moon, and star, yet knows not where he fits." If you need help, it can be solved
as follows: Place the bird on the star mark on the lower right, the dragon on
the sun mark in the upper-right corner, the beast on the sun mark in the upper-
left corner, and the warrior on the moon mark directly to the right of the
beast. Completing this entire test nets you the [PROOF OF WITS].

The Test of Friendship
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
In these three trials, you have to control both Oliver and Esther simultaneously
to get them across the paths, without them falling off. As soon as you start,
the tiles will start falling down behind you, so a little speed is essential.
The first path is straightforward, but the second path requires you to stand on
switches to create bridges for the other person. The third path makes the two
paths cross from the left to the right and vice versa, so you might want to
control just one character at a time and quickly switch to the next. There are
no penalties for falling off, so you can try as often as you'd like. Finishing
this test grants you the [PROOF OF FRIENDSHIP].

The Test of Strength
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
The third and final test is a boss battle, as you might've expected. Talk to
Solomon when you're ready to initiate it.

 _____________________
| BOSS FIGHT: BASHURA |
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  STATS:   870 HP, Weak against: Water, Resists: Fire
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯
  ATTACKS: 1. Physical Attack [Single Target, Minor Damage]
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ 2. Devastation [All Allies, Medium Damage]
           3. Mind Over Matter [Range, Minor Damage]

  REWARDS: 435 EXP, 360 G, Spirit of the Temple
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
It's important to know that Bashura is programmed in such a way to only focus on
the character that you're *not* controlling. This allows you to get a familiar
to his side - not his back, which has magnificent defense thanks to the gigantic
shield - and pummel him. Thumbelemur and Mite are both good options, and a
flurry of attacks will often cancel Bashura's attacks, allowing you to pull off
an even longer assault.

None of his attacks are really worth even worrying about, as the most damage he
will do in one hit is ~30. If one of your characters gets in trouble, switch
over to them and move them out of the way. You could also heal them from a
distance; both options work well.

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

After the battle, you receive the page of [BASHURA] and the [PROOF OF STRENGTH].
Sage Solomon also rewards you with the [BRIDGE] and [BROOM BROOM] spells, as
well as the important [HEART-WINNING HARP].

Now that you have this harp, Esther can play serenades to seduce creatures into
becoming your familiar. You're given a tutorial on this in which you'll have to
select one out of three potential familiars: Shonky-Honker, Boggly-Boo, or a
Naiad. The Shonky-Honker is an all round familiar and fairly weak early in the
game, but has the potential to grow out to be the strongest familiar in the game
in terms of the magical attack stat. Boggly-Boo is a strong attacker which will
learn elemental attacks, and the Naiad is a familiar that is best used for
healing. If you plan on mastering Ni no Kuni, the Shonky-Honker might be a wise
decision. You can, however, catch these familiars later too.

Start the battle and fight the familiar of your choice, then play the serenade
as it falls in love with you. In regular battles there's only a small chance
that a creature does this, so you'll have to keep an eye out for when it does.

You'll also be shown how familiar metamorphosis works; this means your Mite is
undergoing a required metamorphosis. You'll be given a [SUNDROP] treat; give it
to Mite and he'll change into Mighty Mite. Unfortunately, this resets his level
back to 1, meaning he won't be as strong (in the beginning) as your Mite. On
the plus side, a level 1 familiar is leveled up very quickly and the first ten
levels should be a breeze to get.

Then there's the Familiar Retreat, which allows you to store any unneeded
familiars away (up to a total of 400). The first time you use it you'll receive
vials of [GREAT SAGE'S SECRET x3], basically an Elixir-like item that fully
restores the HP and MP of one character. You also receive [JUMBO SUNDROPS x3],
[JUMBO STARDROPS x3], [JUMBO MOONDROPS x3] and [JUMBO PLANETDROPS x3]. These are
all used to metamorphose your familiars (into their third forms). For now you'll
want to hold on to your familiars, but the retreat will prove very valuable
later in the game.

NOTE: You never have to worry about having too many familiars with you. If you
¯¯¯¯¯ catch a familiar when all your slots are full, it's automatically sent to
      the Familiar Retreat.

      As for familiars to get now, we strongly recommend getting a Sunshine, as
      it will be useful for an Errand later on. Other than that, the Green
      Buncher makes for a nice physical attacker for Esther.

TIP: The Great Sage's Secret item is quite useful in (boss) battles, but before
¯¯¯¯ using any such Elixir, it's important to know that they can be sold for the
     massive amount of 6000 G. Especially early in the game, it's highly
     profitable to sell at least one of these (and possibly more) to solve all
     your financial problems for a long time to come. Great Sage's Secret is not
     unique and can be gotten later in the game, although they do remain fairly
     rare. And in case you were wondering, no, they're not used in any Alchemy
     formula (Alchemy is something you'll get soon enough), so the only reason
     you could have for keeping them around would be to use them in a battle to
     restore *one* ally's HP and MP for the price of 6000 G (in our opinion,
     hardly worth the price).


AL MAMOON - ADDITIONAL EXPLORATION [WLK-2.5]
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
You'll now have the opportunity to do several things. You can complete two more
errands, and there are various treasures on the world map waiting to be found.

NOTE: Now is also your last chance to backtrack and tell Old Father Oak about
¯¯¯¯¯ your adventure so far.  It's a rather long road to backtrack, and (this
      time) the only reward is some unique dialogue, so you might just want to
      read it below. Old Father Oak usually gives items, just not this time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Old Father Oak: "Ho ho ho! A new companion, hm? How very exciting!"
Oliver: "Uh-huh! Her name is Esther! She's awful clever, and-"
Drippy: "Oh, I see! She's CLEVER, is she!? Not like old Drippy, then? Silly old
         Drippy - always getting things wrong! And after all I've done!
         Ungrateful so-and-so..."
Oliver: "N-No, Mr. Drippy! I didn't mean that, I was just-"
Drippy: "Save youer breath, mun! Written all over youer innocent little face, it
         is! Youer lucky I'm not a sensitive soul! I'll just have to hope
         there's someone out there who'll appreciate a sidekick as lovable and
         funny and reliable as little old me..."
Old Father Oak: "Now, now, children! This is no time to let the green-eyed
                 monster get the better of us!"
Drippy: "Oh, and now I'm a monster, is it? Kick me while I'm down, why don't
         you?"
Oliver: "No, Mr. Drippy! You've got it all wrong! Gee, I don't know what I'd do
         without you! Please, you can't leave me! I need you!"
Drippy: "Well, er...since you put it like that, I s'pose I could stick around
         a bit longer, like..."
Old Father Oak: "Ho ho ho! You are as susceptible to flattery as you are to
                 jealousy, I see, Drippy! How very like you! Ho ho ho!"
Drippy: "What are you on about, mun? That wasn't flattery, that was the truth,
         plain and simple!"
Old Father Oak: "Very well, have it your way. I am just glad to see that you are
                 friends again. Now, on your way, and no more bickering!"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In any case, head back to Al Mamoon and while on your way you'll be told to
head to Old Smoky, the volcano in the far southwest. You might want to return to
Al Mamoon first to do another errand, though. You can also complete Errand #048.

| DESCRIPTION: A man in Al Mamoon who goes by the name of Derwin asked you to  |

| You can find Derwin the academic researcher on the east side of Al Mamoon.   |
| He's a researcher of familiars and needs you to catch some. To be more       |
| precise, he requires a Green Buncher and a Turbandit.                        |

| For your reference, the Green Buncher is the large, green, vegetable-like    |
| familiar while the Turbandit is the small, purple fellow with, well, a       |
| turban. Both can be found in the desert, and you'll most likely have to      |
| fight a lot of them before they can be caught by Esther's Serenade.          |

WORLD MAP EXPLORATION - SHIMMERING SANDS EAST, SOUTHEAST & OLD SMOKY PATH
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
ITEMS: [ ] Carrot Cake, [ ] Shadowglass, [ ] Shinbone Shield,
¯¯¯¯¯¯ [ ] Hallowed Habit Robe, [ ] Burning Blade

*ITEMS: [ ] Glowcap, [ ] Baneflower, [ ] Shadowglass
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

ENEMIES: Tu-Whit, Turburn, Shonky-Honker, Floret, Turbandit, Small Fry,
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ Green Buncher, Sunshine, Lightshade, Boggly-Boo, Bonehead
________________________________________________________________________________

In case you haven't done so by yourself already, there are several more
treasures for you to find in the Shimmering Sands. The previous world map
exploration (of this area) yielded five treasures in the northwest and west
regions of the area. We'll now be exploring the rest (as far as possible).

   East/Northeast region
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
 * On the right side of Al Mamoon's oasis are twinkling stars, indicating a
   forage point that contains, unsurprisingly, [SPRINGWATER].

 • Slightly southeast of Al Mamoon lies a large rock with some plants nearby.
   Search the place around the plants to find [CARROT CAKE x2].

 * To the east of Al Mamoon, and slightly northwest of the large rock as
   indicated on your world map (although there are several rocks that are not
   displayed on the map) you can find some twinkling stars that net a [GLOWCAP].

 • In the far northeast corner of the desert, search the area near the plants
   against the most northern rock to find [SHADOWGLASS x2].

   Southeast region
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
   WARNING: The creatures in this area are much tougher than the ones in the
            northern regions, so you'll want to be at least Level 15+. It's
            certainly possible to evade creatures, but do save your game before
            trying this. You can also wait with exploring this area until later.

 • The rock plateaus on the southeast can be accessed from their northeastern
   side. On the tip of the southernmost plateau (which is just one level down
   after climbing up to the highest plateau), look for a [SHINBONE SHIELD].

 • These plateaus also give access to a more grassy ledge. The southernmost tip
   has a hidden [HALLOWED HABIT ROBE] for you to dig up.

 * The rocky plateau that branches off to the southwest from the grassy ledge
   contains a forage point; the twinkling stars should be easily spotted. It
   contains a piece of [SHADOWGLASS].

   Old Smoky path
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
 • On your way to Old Smoky, keep your eyes open for the first crack of lava
   and inspect it at its largest flowing point to find a [BURNING BLADE].

 * Further down the path to Old Smoky, to the far west of the path - requiring
   you to cast the 'Bridge' spell you can find a twinkling forage point between
   some trees.  Here you'll find a [BANEFLOWER].

 • Just to the northeast of Old Smoky's entrance, inspect the far end of the
   path to find a [PHOENIX FEATHER] near the lava stream.


OLD SMOKY - THE MOLTEN MOUNTAIN [WLK-2.6]
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
ITEMS: [ ] Moondrop, [ ] Phoenix Feather, [ ] Sandwich, [ ] Flame Robes,
¯¯¯¯¯¯ [ ] Burning Blade, [ ] Strong Coffee, [ ] Cloud Cover

PAGES: [ ] 215 (Moltaan)
¯¯¯¯¯¯

ENEMIES: Deep Fry, Boggly-Boo, Little Bighorn, Shrimpaler, Ruffian,
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ Hullaballoon, Moltaan (*)
________________________________________________________________________________

Follow the path until you reach an intersection. The northern path leads to a
dead-end with a broken-down robot, so head east to reach another split. The
southeastern path leads to a sealed purple chest, where the path ends, so go
up the northeastern path and collect the [MOONDROP] from the chest as you
travel on.

TIP: The enemies in this area frequently leave various kinds of 'drops'
¯¯¯¯ behind: Sundrop, etc. These items will come in handy sooner or later when
     you want to metamorphose some of your familiars, so be sure to stock up
     on a few.

At the next intersection, definitely head left/west first to reach a dead end
with two regular chests containing a [PHOENIX FEATHER] and [SANDWITCH], along
with a sealed blue chest that contains a [FLAME ROBES] upon opening it with
'Spring Lock'.

Keep following the path and you'll notice that it really looks like it's about
to erupt. Continue until you reach an intersection; the right/northeastern path
leads to a chest with a [BURNING BLADE] inside. Follow the other path up the
mountain until you reach a Waystone - heal up and save.

The left path at the next intersection leads to an inaccessible green chest, so
head right and cast your Frostbite spell to continue over the stream of lava.

Drippy then tells you that there are only three minutes left to stop the volcano
from erupting, so get moving! [It will indeed be game over if the timer reaches
zero, so get a move on. It's also good to know that the timer stops during
battles. You'll still want to hurry up if you wish to get the treasures; you
only have roughly 10 seconds to spare. You can also skip the treasures and head
for the goal, then backtrack (since the timer will be gone).] Make your way
northeast, scaling along the edge while avoiding the steam coming out of the
wall; those won't do any damage, but they will cost you time. Once you're on the
other side, keep going along the path until you see path shoot off a bit to the
west. Open the chest at the dead- end here for a cup of [STRONG COFFEE].

Head back to the main path and continue north and west, following along the
long, spiraling path until you come to another lava stream; use your Frostbite
spell to pass it. A little further on you'll reach a fork splitting northeast
and southwest; quickly take the northeastern path first to come to a dead-end
containing a [CLOUD CLOVER] cloak.

Head back to the fork and continue southwest, and you'll eventually come to
another thin ledge that you have to scale. Cross it, then once you've made it to
the other side and to the yellow star, you'll find out nothing happens after
all. Figures! Feel free to relax a bit now, since the timer is gone, and get
your party situated if you need. Recover your HP and MP and save at the
Waystone.

TIP: Now's also a good time to equip the Cloud Clover on Thumbelemur, as it'll
¯¯¯¯ make him faster and gives him better defense. Definitely equip your Flame
     Robes on your Drongo (and Seed Sprite, if you brought it). Any other good
     equipment you haven't yet given your familiars should now be put to use
     as well.

     Also, because of that short event with the "timer", you'll actually miss a
     part of the map. If you don't want to backtrack here later for the sake of
     completions, head back southwest between the two pieces of map (main area,
     then the crater) to ensure that you get it 100%. Check your Telling Stone's
     "Dangerous Places" to double check the number.

Continue northeast to the crater, where Shadar will summon a giant lava beast
for you to take on!

  REWARDS: 650 EXP, 420 G, Spirit of the Flame.

  ¯¯¯¯¯¯ 
You'll want to stay as Oliver in this battle, spamming your Frostbite spell
against Moltaan. Stay to the far edge of the field while firing off that spell,
and don't worry too much about your HP; Esther should keep your HP up. If your
HP does manage to fall below 50, then take a moment to either use an item or
cast Healing Touch to keep you going.

The only attack that does major damage is his physical attack when decides to go
on a rampage on one ally. Other than that, all of his attacks will do well under
40 damage each time, leaving you plenty of time to attack before you have to
worry about healing. Honestly, none of them are even worth defending, so focus
on blasting him with your ice.

As you go on with the battle, Drippy will let you know that its tail is the weak
spot, so try to stay behind him while blasting him with Frostbite. Fire away and
watch your MP, using a Strong Coffee as needed to keep it from reaching a point
where you can't cast spells.

After you've finally done enough damage, the beast will stumble back into the
lava, and Oliver will knock the massive rock into the lava on top of him,
effectively ending the battle.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

After the battle, you'll receive the page for [MOLTAAN]. A portal will also open
up afterward, allowing instant teleportation to the foot of the mountain. From
there, simply return to Al Mamoon by foot. After debriefing Rashaad, several
bounties and a new errand become available, which you might just want to check
out.


AL MAMOON - LOOSE ENDS [WLK-2.7]
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
ITEMS: [ ] Phoenix Feather x3
¯¯¯¯¯¯
________________________________________________________________________________

NOTE: Now that you've defeated Moltaan, you can report your progress to Old
¯¯¯¯¯ Father Oak and earn yourself [PHOENIX FEATHER x3]; however, since you
      might want to backtrack for several items soon enough, you'll want to
      save yourself the trouble of having to do this twice, so postpone this
      for a little while until the time is ripe.

Head over to Swift Solutions to find two new bounties available. A look at the
errands board reveals that one new errand can now be done as well.

| ERRAND #080 - Notes from a Volcano |
|¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯|
| DESCRIPTION: A man visiting Al Mamoon is rather flustered after misplacing   |
| ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ his diary again.                                                |

|                                                                              |
| Speak with the rich man located to your immediate left as you enter the      |
| town square of Al Mamoon, and you should recognize him as the traveler from  |
| Ding Dong Dell. Looks like he lost his diary again, so off you go.           |
|                                                                              |
| This time the diary can be found on the trail leading to Old Smoky. It's not |
| too far away actually. Once you pass the first large crack in the ground     |
| (on the left side), inspect the big tree just behind it to find the actual   |
| [TRAVELER'S DIARY]; this is slightly southeast of the first lava stream (in  |
| which you have found a Burning Blade before). Return to the man to claim     |
| your reward.                                                                 |

| BOUNTY #091 - Merchants' Menace |
|¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯|
| DESCRIPTION: A monster has been attacking traveling merchants and stealing   |
| ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ their wares. It must be dealt with as soon as possible!         |

| This bounty is located to the far south, in the grassy area near Castaway    |
| Cove. More specifically, you'll need to create a bridge (with the 'Bridge'   |
| spell) to travel to the east part of the area, where it resides on a hill to |
| the south.                                                                   |
|                                                                              |
| The Gobspeed is accompanied by two lesser Hog-Goblins, making this a rather  |
| tough fight for this point in the game. You'll want to be around level 20,   |
| and you might also want to give your familiar your current best equipment,   |
| such as the Burning Blade (among other things).                              |
|                                                                              |
| Your first priority should be to take out one of the Hog-Goblins, but don't  |
| lose track of Oliver or Esthers' health; as soon as they fall below 50% of   |
| their HP, quickly cast a healing spell or give them a proper health boost    |
| by way of items. When the first Hob-Goblin is eliminated, heal your party    |
| and go for the second one. With just the Gobspeed left, the remainder of the |
| battle should be much easier to handle.                                      |
|                                                                              |
| If you're having trouble and taking too much damage with just your familars, |
| then try fighting as Oliver and continuously cast Pule to knock them away as |
| they're about to carry out their attacks, and it should minimize the damage. |

| Magmoiselle can be found at Old Smoky; head north at the first intersection  |
| to find her at the dead end with the broken robot. She's a unique creature   |
| that can only be fought during this bounty.                                  |

| This battle isn't too hard if you give Esther her Drongo while you stay in   |
| control of Oliver himself and keep casting Frostbite. Magmoiselle will       |
| usually keep chasing after you, and althrough her physical attacks are quite |
| powerful, keeping a distance isn't that hard. She also has a more powerful   |
| fire-based long range attack; defending against it works best.               |

By now you should have a few merit cards left to exchange for powerups. It's
up to you to decide, although Jack-in-the-Box (if you don't already have it)
may prove useful in dungeons and parts of the world map with more powerful
adversaries.

WORLD MAP EXPLORATION - CASTAWAY COVE AREA [WLK-2.8]
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ Purrloiner, Hog-Goblin, Rhinosnore
________________________________________________________________________________


 * There's a small pool of water just west of the entrance to the Castaway Cove
   area (where the grassy fields begin). Search the twinkling forage point to
   find a [WETSTONE].

 * To the far (north)west of the area is a ramp leading up to the rocky
   platforms. It's a bit of a walk, but you can find a twinkling forage point
   on the far north-middle side; it contains a piece of [SHADOWGLASS].

 • Head to the far (south)west of these plains, then continue over the platforms
   to the east. At the very end of this path, after you have gone east, then
   turn south and back to the west, where the cliff of the sea intersects with a
   higher platform, search the ground for a [STURDY SHINBONE].

 * Return to the grassy fields of Castaway Cove. On the far southwest platform
   adjacent to the sea and near the mountains you should be able to spot this
   twinkling forage point containing [RINGS-A-BELL].

 • The adjacent platform immediately below (with a bunch of trees) contains a
   [STRONG COFFEE]. Search the middle of the ridge closest to the sea.

 * Head to the far east side of the Castaway Cove area; this requires you to
   build a bridge (with the 'Bridge' spell) if you hadn't already do so. The
   twinkling forage point in the middle of the upper platform contains a bundle
   of [SLUMBERNOT LEAVES].

 • In the same area, head to the far south(east) of the area, traveling through
   the forest zone until you reach a small beach to the far south. Search the
   soil to find [SALTED ICE CREAM x2].

Castaway Cove can be found somewhere in the middle of the far south coastline.
If you have trouble finding it, use your map for guidance.

As soon as you enter, a cutscene plays; you're now supposed to chase the thief
who stole the cauldron from a merchant. If your characters aren't fully healed,
visit the Cat's Cradle (inn) first, because a boss fight is coming up. This also
grants you [THE LOST CONTINENT] page, and while you're here you might as well
grab an [ICED COFFEE] and a bar of [MILK CHOCOLATE] from the pot and chest
respectively (but not respectfully).

Head to the far east side of town and take the lower path to visit the docks.
The thief is located at the last one; approach him and a scene will play,
leaving you with the [PECULIAR POT]. Of course, poor Drippy's the one to have to
lug it on his back...

Return to the owner, who doesn't seem to happy about all of this, then look at
page 74 of your Wizard's Companion to find the keycode that unlocks the
cauldron: Open Says-A-Me. (Open Sesame, get the pun?) This triggers a scene and
a boss battle.

 ______________________
| BOSS FIGHT: AL-KHEMI |
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  STATS:   1520 HP, Weak against: ---, Resists: Water
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯
  ATTACKS: 1. Physical Attack [Single Target, Minor to Medium Damage]
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ 2. Al-Khombo [Flurry of attacks, Major Damage, Use Defend!]
           3. Alakaz...Um... (Burning Sword) [Greatly increases his strength]
           4. Alakaz...Um... (Parasol) [Greatly reduces his strength]
           5. Hubble-Bubble [10 Second Countdown, Major Damage to all allies,
                             Use Defend!]

  REWARDS: 777 EXP, 620 G
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
The fight against Al-Khemi is both funny and tough. Since his normal attacks
contantly interrupt any physical attacks directed toward him, start your battle
using Oliver and cast Pulse repeatedly, only breaking to heal either himself or
Esther.

The fight against Al-Khemi is both funny and tough. His regular physical attacks
deal some damage, but aren't anything to worry about. His Al-Khombo attack,
however, is very powerful and hits multiple times. Whoever Al-Khemi is facing
will be the lucky target, so if he targets the character/familiar you're NOT
controlling, quickly switch to that character and defend. 

The Alakaz...Um.... attack comes in two varieties. If Al-Khemi pulls out his
burning sword, stay away, heal your party, and use long distance attacks such as
Pulse. On the other hand, if he pulls out his parasol, rush in with your
strongest familiar and whack him as much as you can.

When Al-Khemi gets low on health, down to roughly 20% of his HP, he'll dive
into his cauldron with the Hubble-Bubble attack. It has a countdown of 10
seconds, so heal your party members and defend when the counter reaches 3 to
minimize damage. Be sure to quickly heal up your other party member, then start
attacking Al-Khemi again to finish him off.

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

After defeating Al-Khemi you'll become his master; you get the [CAULDRON],
giving you access to Alchemy. Al-Khemi (get the pun?) also gives you a bottle
of [PIXIE DEW], a bunch of [SOUR GRAPES], and [SLUMBERNOT LEAVES x3]. You have
to combine these in the Alchemy tutorial, resulting in a [SPRITE DEW], a great
healing item that restores 200 HP to all party members. (You will also have
gotten the [SPRITE DEW FORMULA (006)], of course.)

There are a total of 134 recipes in the game, and many of them can be gotten
by talking to NPC's. You'll get more recipes in a few moments.

Head back to the docks where you found the thief and you'll trigger a scene in
which the Governor gives you three sets of [BATHING SUITS]. Feel free to explore
the town now.

First, stop by at the lady with the red turban standing on a small boat in the
westernmost pier. She gives you a ton of recipes: [SANDWICH FORMULA (003),
[FISHBURGER FORMULA (002)], [STRONG COFFEE FORMULA (007)], [CAPPUCCINO FORMULA
(008)], [MILK CHOCOLATE FORMULA (013)], [CREAMY FLAN FORMULA (018)], [CARROT
CAKE FORMULA (023)], [SOUR SUNDAE FORMULA (028)], [SWEETIE PIE FORMULA (033)] &
[SALTED ICE CREAM (038)].

Castaway Cove also houses various chests and pots. Return to the entrance as
we'll start exploring from that point. Head over the bridge to your left/
northeast to find a slice of [SWEETIE PIE] and [20 - 40 G] from the chest and
pot respectively. Head east and look for a glimmering pot just before the curve
which contains a [CAKE or CHOCOLATE or FLAN].

Head over the nearby bridge leading south and talk to Horace (who only appears
if you've spoken to, and completed his assignments before). After casting
'Spirit Medium' on him, he'll ask you to translate a piece of Nazcaän from your
Wizard's Companion. Look at page 13 and closely inspect the wizard's robe to
locate the symbols. You can translate these with the Nazcaän Alphabet (at the
bottom right on the overview page of the book) to find that it reads: 'Finest
Fiber'. Give the answer to Horace and he'll reward you with the [VACATE] spell,
which allows you to teleport out of dungeons; rather handy!

Now make your way over to the docks and look for a chest on the right side at
the bottom of the stairs to find a [SANDWICH]. There's also a blue chest on the
first pier to the north with a [FISHBURGER] inside.

Now's a good time to do a few errands, although there aren't all that many
available. Stop by Swift Solutions at the northwestern end of town and make sure
to activate all of 'em (why does the jerk Taskmaster get to stay fully clothed?)
then proceed to your destination on the map. Talk to the man here--Sindbah--who
sends you back to Al Mamoon to get permission from her royal highness Cowlipha
to ride the ship.

Return to Al Mamoon and attempt to enter the palace.. Access denied! Head over
to the Cat's Cradle (inn) and speak with the purrprietor to trigger a scene.
Afterward, cast the Gateway spell and travel back to Motorville.

Head over to Leila's shop, triggering a scene. Afterward it's back to Al
Mamoon, where you must inspect the left milk fountain on the town square and
cast the 'Secret Ingredient' spell to conjure a [GIANT CHEESE WEDGE] out of thin
air (and some milk, of course). You can now speak to Abull, who'll let you into
the castle. Unfortunately, the Cowlipha appears to be in need of some restraint,
which you must now go out and seek. (Quite a frightening scene, that was.)

Visit the Cawtermaster first, who tells you that Abull's the one you're looking
for. Don't forget to purchase a Flint Dagger here for errand 76 (unless you
already have one) now that you're here anyway. Return to the castle, take some
restraint from Abull and give it to her Moojesty! This returns things to ..
well, things are indeed a little different now. After the scenes you'll receive
a [LETTER OF PASSAGE], a [PORTRAIT], as well as the [NATURE'S TONGUE] and
[BURDEN] spells.

Before you leave town, talk to the boy near the entrance of town to do a new
errand (#047). It lets you make good use of your newly acquired spell.

| Talk to the boy near the entrance of Al Mamoon to start this errand. You'll  |

Return to Castaway Cove to trigger a scene. Be sure to rest at the Cat's Cradle
if your party isn't funkyfresh at the moment, because we've got a boss battle
coming up! You might also want to stock up on Sleep-Be-Gones as well as some
Confusion-Be-Gones from the peddler. When you're all set, head for the pier to
face what looks to be another nightmare creature.

 ________________________________
| BOSS FIGHT: SWAINE'S NIGHTMARE |
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  STATS:   1280 HP, Weak against: Light, Resists: Dark
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯
  ATTACKS: 1. Physical Attack [Single Target, Minor to Medium Damage]
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ 2. Bad Dream [All Targets, Inflicts Sleep]
           3. Grudge [Single Target, Inflicts Curse]

  REWARDS: 860 EXP, 700 G
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
This Nightmare creature will frequently attempt to put your characters to sleep,
or otherwise curse them, significantly impairing their movement, allowing it
to hit you with quite a few nasty regular physical attacks.

Move in with a familiar right away and perform an all out attack. The sleep
ailment is annoying since Nightmare might inflict a critical hit on you, but
after any such hit you're good to go again; heal up and continue your sequence
of attacks. Also keep an eye on your second party member's health and don't let
it drop below 40-50%.

If you see Nightmare charging up for Bad Dream, it's quite possible to cancel
the attack with a series of attacks, and you should always attempt this if
you're high on HP. It might just generate a golden glim. If it does, the battle
is surely in it's last phase.

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

After the fight, find the restraint you're looking for by visiting the Cat's
Cradle, where you'll find the Governor, who's more than willing to share a
piece. Bring this back to the quayside and heal the thief, who's name turns out
to be Swaine. He and his Hurly familiar will join you, incidentally also
granting you the ability to open up green chests with his pickpocket's pistol.
Walk up to the green chest nearby and lock onto it to collect the [FLING FLAME
GEM] inside it!

________________________________________________________________________________


Before you set sail, there are several things you can do in town first, and
there are also green chests in other locations that you had to skip earlier on.

   List of Green Chests 
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
 • Location: Castaway Cove. Head to the entrance of the town and cross the
   bridge to southeast. After crossing it, take a few minor steps to your right
   and turn around, facing south. You can spot the green chest across the water,
   lying on a pier. Use Swaine's Pistol to collect a [CARNATION CAKE] (a high
   level treat that increases magical attack).

 • Location: Old Smoky. Make your way to the (2nd) Waystone in the middle of
   the area and take the left path at the intersection just up ahead. The green
   chest can be found at the end; it contains [PIXIE DEW]. You can cast the
   Vacate spell to quickly teleport back to the world map.

 • Location: Al Mamoon. Head up to the town square and stop just before stepping
   onto the actual plaza. Walk to the right/east side of the street, position
   yourself between the palm tree and the man with a turban, then look up; this
   green chest is hidden away on the roof of the building on the west side and
   contains a [RUBY RIPPLE ICE CREAM] (another high level treat that increases
   evasion).
 
 • Location: Golden Grove. Entering the place from the Shimmering Sands, follow
   the path to the crossroads and head north. Use Quicken Growth on the
   mushrooms if you hadn't already and step up the fourth one; look to your left
   to spot the green chest, which contains a bar of [FAIRY CHOCOLATE] (another
   high level treat - this one increases attack). If you're traveling to the
   other side of the Golden Grove, don't cast Vacate; it'll drop you off at the
   side from which you entered.
 
 • Location: Ding Dong Dell. Head to the west part of town and walk to the most
   southern tip of the area, where you'll spot three vases against the town's
   wall. Look down next to the tree to spot the green chest; it contains a slice
   of [SEE-THROUGH PIE] (you've guessed it; this one boosts accuracy).
 
 • Location: Ding Dong Well. Head to the waypoint at the end of the area. From
   here, head all the way south to find the green chest behind bars to the east.
   It contains a [WATER BOMB GEM] (which teaches the Water Bomb Trick to a
   familiar). Either use the Vacate spell, or travel to the square beyond the
   waystone to find a warp circle that allows teleportation back to the entrance
   of the well.

 • Location: Hidden Forest Glade in the northeast forests of Ding Dong Dell.
   The chest is located behind the tree closest to the man talking to his wife.
   Stand a bit east from the blue chest to find the vantage point for Swaine.
   It contains a [PEBBLE PELT GEM].

 • Location: Hidden Forest Glade on the northwest plains of the Northern
   Summerlands (Ding Dong Dell area), to the far west of the Deep Dark Wood.
   See below for more details:

   Now that you have the bridge spell, as well as Swaine in your party, it might
   be a good idea to explore the northwest plains of the Summerlands. BEWARE,
   however; the creatures are TOUGH, and you'll want to avoid them. Save your
   game before attempting this optional exploration, and keep multiple save
   files so you can also save your game after getting each single treasure,
   without getting yourself in trouble.
   
   In any case, just slightly (south)west of the Deep Dark Wood, a bridge can
   now be made (with the Bridge spell), allowing entrance to the western plains.

 * There's a forage point to the north of the section, located between some
   trees, which contains a [RINGS-A-BELL].

 • Just slightly west of the northern forage point in the section, search the
   sole tree that is standing at a slight distance from the other trees to find
   a [PLANETDROP].

 • There's a hidden forest glade to the far west of this area, stashed away
   behind the mountains; walk around them and enter the forest at the far end.
   Inside is a regular chest with some [SLUMBERNOT LEAVES]. Also take note of
   the green chest on top of the statue. The vantage point (for Swaine) is 
   a little northwest of the red chest. It contains a [PIXIE DEW].

 • Travel to the south part of the plains and stop when you reach a lower plain.
   Still on the upper (western) path, search the edge of the rock wall that
   partly separates the lower plains from the upper path; it's directly south
   of a small forest. The soil here contains a [BABANA FLAN].

 • Travel to the far southeast tip of the plains, which is just north of a lake
   with a waterfall, and search the ground for a [WILDFLOWER SUNDAE].

Now's also an excellent time (as well as your last chance for this particular
story progression interval) to stop by Old Father Oak and tell him about your
progress. As way of thanks he gives you a nice [PHOENIX FEATHER x3].
 
There are also various errands you can now do in Castaway Cove.

It's smart to purchase the best equipment for your familiars at the peddler if
you hadn't already, however, some of the equipment gotten from Alchemy is better
and costs less to make. Should you be low on money, remember that you can always
sell some of your Great Sage's Secret for 6000 G.

There are several items and pieces of equipment that you can now create by
Alchemy. Below are the ones most useful at this point. Most items needed can
be bought from shops in Al Mamoon, others are found at forage points or dropped
by, and stolen from creatures:

Shadowglass Knife: Flint Dagger + Shadowglass
Knucklebone Claws: Crude Claws + Sturdy Shinbone
Toughened Armor:   Rugged Armor + Supple Leather
Stripy Cloak:      Snakeskin Cloak + Supple Leather
Poisoned Fang:     Giant's Tooth + Baneflower
Stalwart Scale:    Sturdy Shinbone + Wetstone

The following two can be gotten very shortly:

Scale Shield: Leather Shield + Sturdy Scale + Angula
Breezy Cloak: Sea Breeze Cloak + Angula x2

When you're all set, approach the ship to sail away!

         *Only the enemies you can handle at this point are listed above.
________________________________________________________________________________


You can now explore the worldmap, although many enemies are way too strong for
you to currently handle. There are, nonetheless, several areas you might want to
check out already before going straight to Autumnia.

 • Visit the previously inaccessible beach that is just to the northwest of
   Castaway Cove and search the rock wall in the middle for a [POINTY HAT],
   which is an excellent piece of defensive equipment for Hurly, Swaine's
   familiar.

 * (South)east of Castaway Cove lies Robinson Island, a series of small isles.
   Disembark at the first small (westernmost) island to find a forage point
   that contains a [GNOMEBEARD].

 * A second forage point can be found on Robinson Island itself, in the middle
   of the western area, near some bush. It contains an [ANGULA], which is used
   in some useful alchemy formulas as seen above.

 • The far south tip of Robinson Island contains a [SACRED DAGGER], which is
   a pretty good weapon at this point in the game. It has a small chance (3%)
   to inflict Nix on enemies whenever it strikes.

 • For the last treasure on Robinson Island, you can find [FISHBURGER x2] at the
   base of the (north)easternmost palm tree.

   (The crab from errand #050 can also be found on the nearby sandbank.)

 • East from Robinson Island lies a small sandbank with a large shell on its
   south side. Inspect it to find a [FINE FROCK], which is an excellent piece
   of equipment for the time being.

 * To the northeast of Robinson Island (as well as the small sandbank) lies
   Friday Island. There's a forage point next to the lone palmtree that gives
   you [SLUMBERNOT LEAVES x2].

 • Head to the far north tip of Friday Island and inspect the palm trees to
   find [STURDY SHINBONE x2].

Now's also an excellent time to do the three bounties from Castaway Cove (#093,
#094 & #095).

| These catbandits can be found on the small island south of Robinson Island.  |
| Be sure to defeat the Purrloiner first, then heal your party and solely      |
| focus on the Cutpurrse, only going for the Puss in Bouts after its comrades  |
| have fallen. It helps to have water spells/tricks, but they're not really    |

| creature is weak against it. Abilities such as Thunderspark are particularly |
| effective in this battle, so be sure to command your Drongo manually and     |
| have a full MP bar at the start of the fight.                                |

| To the northeast of Castaway Cove is a piece lies a piece of unexplored land |
| of which one entrance is blocked by a big Collum. Defeating it is best done  |
| by keeping your distance (with the possible exception of Swaine's Hurly) and |
| casting Storm-elemental attacks with your Drongo. Equip other familiars such |
| as the Mite with Storm-based equipment to give you a small advantage.        |
|______________________________________________________________________________|


You can now head back and claim the bounties. If you have any full Merit Cards
left you can now purchase a new Merit Award; Jolly Jack-Tar. This allows your
ship to move faster, also making it easier to avoid any unwanted encounters with
enemies. If you've been doing all errands and bounties so far, it's the last
award currently available. If your party members are exhausted from all the
fights, head over to the Cat's Cradle as well to heal up.

NOTE: By completing all Bounty Hunts up until now, you should receive the 'New
¯¯¯¯¯ Sheriff in Town' trophy for completing 10 Bounties.

When you're ready, head back to your ship and set sail to Shipwreck Shore!


The Shipwreck Shore
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
WARNING: You're about to explore an area with very powerful enemies. Save your
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ game beforehand and keep multiple files so you can even save during
         your exploration without possibly getting stuck somewhere.

Head to the piece of unexplored land to the northeast of Castaway Cove (where
you fought the Collum), which is properly called 'Shipwreck Shore'. The enemies
here are BRUTAL, so it's best to save your game and try to avoid them while
searching for the following treasures. You have been WARNED. Remember that you
can also run from enemies; it's wise to do so around here.

 • Enter the area through the arch on the south. Directly left/west of the
   arch (on the northern side) you can find [CAPPUCCINO x2] next to the curved
   rock wand.

 • There's a hidden Forest Glade on the top of the eastern plateau next to the
   arch. To get here, travel along the west side to reach the top of the hill,
   then move east over the arch and enter the forest. There are many enemies
   around this area, so be sure to save your game beforehand. Inside the forest
   glade you can grab a [GAME PIE] from the regular chest, note down the
   existence of the purple chest, and stand next to the tree across these two
   chests, looking up to the pillar to the north to notice a green chest with a
   [SAGE'S SECRET] inside.

 * The forage point just south of the hidden Forest Glade contains a
   [GNOMEBEARD], but it's heavily guarded by enemies and might not be worth it
   at this point.

 • It's a little tricky to navigate towards it without getting into any fights,
   but the grassy ridge to the far southwest has [ANGULA x2].

 • Approach the ruins to the north. While the building is inaccessible, the
   pillar directly south (on the right) marks [SEE-THROUGH PIE x2].

 • Taking the arch near the beach as starting point, head all the way north to
   the second set of ruins near the mountains and inspect the big, partly buried
   rectangular stone to find [FISHBURGER x2].

 • Head back to your ship and disembark at the shipwreck just on the eastern
   side of the beach, to the south. Search between the rocks on the southwest
   side of it to find [DUMBFLOUNDER x5].

 • Disembark at the second shipwreck (just to the north of the first) and
   inspect the bottom side of its front to find [GLOWSHRIMP x5].

 * There's also a forage point up the mountain north of the second shipwreck
   that contains an [ANGULA], but the area is roaming with monsters, so it's
   best to harvest it later.

While you can technically explore other areas of the world map at this point,
doing so is very dangerous as the creatures will slaughter you with the blink
of an eye. It's better to sail to your destination, Hamelin.

NOTE: Now is also your last chance to backtrack all the way to Old Father Oak,
¯¯¯¯¯ telling him about your progress. Your reward will be [PIXIE DEW x3].

________________________________________________________________________________

When you get close to your destination, Shadar suddenly appears..

 ____________________
| BOSS FIGHT: SHADAR |
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  STATS:   2050 HP, Weak against: Light, Resists: Dark
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯
  ATTACKS: 1. Fell Wind [Range Attack, Medium Damage]
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ 2. Pyre [Single Target, Medium Damage]
           3. Bleak Midwinter [All Target, Major Damage, Use Defend!]

  REWARDS: ---
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
It's very important to know that you don't have to fully deplete Shadar's HP;
dropping it to 60% is enough. While it's extremely important that you keep your
characters healthy, it's on the other hand just as essential to quickly drain
Shadar's HP, even if you're starting to get low on health yourself. Using
Sandwiches is a good idea; these heal for much more than your healing spells.
Use the tactics command to tell Esther that she should heal the party while you
focus on attacking Shadar with Oliver and Swaine's familiars. If a series of
attacks from your side can prevent Shadar from casting some of his powerful
spells, all the better.

If things go less well - that's how it goes every once in a while - don't
hesitate to play more defensively, unless Shadar's health is really close to
dropping to 60%, in which case you should get those final few blows in to end
the battle. If Shadar charges up for his Bleak Midwinter attack, definitely
try to defend against it, quickly healing up with Sandwiches afterward.

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

You'll find yourself washed ashore Teeheeti Island afterward. You'll now have
access to the All-Out Defense and Attack commands with square and triangle
respectively. You'll also unlock [THE FIFTH TALE] of Wonder for your Wizard's
Companion. Let's search the island for a few treasures now, shall we?

TIP: Now's also a good time to steal an Emberstone from the Mohawk birds on this
¯¯¯¯ island. You need this for errand #076. In fact, it's generally a good idea
     to steal items with Swaine every now and then. Many items will be of use
     eventually in a formula or sidequest.

 • Head east and follow the beach to the north side, cross the creek and inspect
   the cliffs at the far end (at the spot where they intersect with the beach
   and the sea) to find [SPROCKET x2].

 * There's a forage point just northwest of the beach you start at, right
   before the forest starts. It contains a [GNOMEBEARD].

 • Head to the southernmost part of the beach and search the northern tip of
   the sandbank lying between two creeks to find [CARNATION CAKE x2].

 * There's a forage point to the northwest; it's located at the spot where the
   two creeks merge and it contains a [WETSTONE].

 * On the western beach of the island is an arch with a forage point that
   contains a [RINGS-A-BELL]. You'll have to go under the arch to the north,
   then up a hill to the east to get on that level.

 • Search at the base of the pillar (in the water on the western side) that
   supports the arch to find a [SORETOOTH RING].

 • If you follow the western beach to the north, you'll reach a cave, hidden by
   a waterfall running over it. Inside are many crabs that give gameplay tips,
   but there's also a chest with a [FISHBURGER] inside, and a hidden green chest
   on the far west side; position yourself next to the pillar, near the moss-
   covered rocks and look north to collect its [WATER BOMB GEM].

 • Approaching the town in the middle of the island, first travel slightly
   east/northeast from the center and search the grassy part without trees
   (nearby the river) to find a [DRYAD'S SPEAR], an excellent weapon that
   drains 10% of the enemy's healh with every hit.

When you're done talking to crustaceans and collecting treasures, return to your
ship, then proceed directly northwest and into the forest to find out what
Drippy was so worried about. You'll then find out your next destination, so
continue just a bit more north to enter the Fairyground!

'——————————————————————————————————————''——————————————————————————————————————'

Fairies! Fairies everywhere! A group of them will grab Drippy and run off with
him, so let's plod along so we can get him back. Head all the way north for a
scene with... well, let's just say a rather large Fairy Godmother. After some
hilarious dialogue, she'll give you a [SUNDROP], [STARDROP], [MOONDROP], and a
[PLANETDROP] to aid you with raising your familiars. However, you'll now have to
help her with a rather... unique task, so it's off to find some comedians.

When you're done talking to the Fairy Godmother, head down the ladder and move
to the right/west; there's a hidden green chest up the tree beyond the large
rock that contains a [POISON PINCH]. Also look for a regular chest next to a
tree in this area for a [STRONG COFFEE]. Horace the ghost can also be found
here, provided you've spoken with him and performed all tasks he gave you in
previous towns. He wants to know what ingredient no burger can do without.
Looking at pages 92 and 132 of the Wizard's Companion should give a you clue:
the answer is of course 'Crispy Lettuce'. Horace will give you the [SAGE'S
SECRET FORMULA (010)] instead of the Levitate spell (which you must seek out
yourself).

Head back to town and look for Drippy's brothers Surly and Smiley at the Cavity
Club. After a hilarious dialogue (they ARE funny, but just don't know it), you
set off to find eight pieces of art.

Before doing any of that, head back to the entrance of the village and speak to
the seagull using 'Nature's Tongue' to receive the [LEVITATE] spell. As for the
pieces of art, the relevant fairies show up as light blue on your map, so
they're easy to spot.

 1. The long yellow fairy near the entrance is complaining about his large
    horns, so cast the Levitate spell and relieve him from this burden.

 2. Parry the Purrprietor (owner of the inn near the entrance). Set her ass on
    fire (with a proper Fireball) so she stops complaining about being so cold.

 3. The shop on to the right, just a little north from #2, has a green rabbit-
    like fairy who'd like to eat a nice dish; nothing the Secret Ingredient
    spell can't fix!

 4. Huw the Hootenanny from the Hootique further north has broken a jar; cast
    the Rejuvenate spell to fix it.

 5. Just a little northeast from the Hootique is a fairy that can't get the lid
    of a jar off. Casting the Spring Lock spell solves this.

 6. Head to the Cawtermaster and help him make his stuff heavier by casting the
    Burden spell.

 7. Look for a tiny fairy walking around town (check your map for a moving
    light blue dot) who needs his seeds grown; casting Quicken Growth helps him.

 8. Head to the shop in the southeast corner of town. Looks like the owner could
    use some brooming help; casting the Broom Broom spell solves this.

The [PIECES OF ART x8] that you received are enough to continue, but explore
the rest of town first. There's a chest nearby the shop where you got the 8th
piece of art, which contains [100 G]. Directly opposite of it - behind a tree -
is a blue chest with a [CHEESEBURGER] inside. There's a last chest to the far
west side opposite of the Cavity Club, at the start of the path leading to the
northern bridge; it contains a [FISHBURGER].

There are also two pieces of heart you can now collect. South of the Hootique
lies the shop with a giant squid on top of it. One of its customers has some
courage to spare, so stock up. Then there's the fairy in the southeast corner
of town (at a shop, near the small light blue neon stand) who has plenty of
restraint, so be sure to grab some of that as well.

As always, getting a night of rest at the Cat's Cradle nets you two more pages
in your Wizard's Companion, [TEEHEETI] and [THE FAIRYGROUND]. The Cawtermaster
also sells decent wares, most notably the Gale Spear, Massive Mallet and Gale
Robes.

If you hadn't already, now's an excellent time to create one or two Breezy
Cloaks (Sea Breeze Cloak + Angula x2).

When you're all set, talk to Surly and Smiley twice to enter Mummy's Tummy.

Mummy's Tummy - The Faycare Center
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
This is a straightforward area with several rooms in which you'll have to fight
creatures that have invaded the tummy and bullied the little fairies. It's good
to know that the fourth room from the left (the room without a picture on the
door) contains a Waystone, so heal up after each fight and save your game before
heading all the way to the right after the last battle. It's also a good idea to
equip any Burning Blades you have, while unequipping any water-inflicting
weapons. Breezy Cloaks are also an excellent piece of defensive equipment for
the upcoming boss battle.

When you're ready, proceed to the right for an unexpected battle.

 _________________________
| BOSS FIGHT: ROYAL JELLY |
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  STATS:   3180 HP, Weak against: Fire, Resists: Water
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯
  ATTACKS: 1. Physical Attack [Single Target, Minor Damage]
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ 2. See Stars [Single Target, Minor Damage, Confusion Ailment]
           3. Bolt from the Blue [All Targets, Medium to Major Damage,
              Storm Element, Use All-Out Defense!]
           4. Baby Shower [Creates 8 Jelly Baby enemies, Use All-Out Attack!]

  REWARDS: 1020 EXP, 1030 G, Spirit of the Storm
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
The fight with Royal Jelly isn't too hard if you come prepared with the right
equipment (defensive equipment resistant to storm, fire-inflicting Burning
Blades). Its physical attacks are weak, although its See Stars attack (get the
pun?) usually inflicts the confusion effect. Some familiars such as Thumbelemur
have a natural resistance, but there's a great chance someone will become
confused at some point in battle. Fortunately, the effect usually doesn't last
long, as they get hit by attacks soon enough.

The Bolt from the Blue attack hits all your party members for a fairly large
amount of damage, unless your familiar is equipped with a Breezy Cloak, which
makes a large difference. When you see Royal Jelly prepare this attack, quickly
launch an All-Out Defense command while defending with your current character
or familiar. Afterward, healing up with Sandwiches is generally a good idea.

Baby Shower creates eight Jelly Baby enemies and will be used after you've
depleted around 40% of the boss's health. You'll want launch an All-Out Attack
command (since Royal Jelly herself is weakened for the time being) and have a
familiar such as Mite use its ranged Cut Loose trick to greatly damage all the
jellyfish at once. There's a rather big chance that a constant stream of attacks
generates a golden glim; one of the AI controlled familiars might pick it up,
otherwise do so yourself while controlling Oliver; his Miracle Move is a fire
elemental attack and thus inflicts maximum damage.

Using a familiar like Thumbelemur in the final phase of the fight should allow
you to quickly finish off Royal Jelly with Go Wild.

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

After the battle you receive the Royal Jelly Page for your Wizard's Companion
and exit the Fairy Godmother's tummy. It's too easy to make a pun during this
scene, revolving mainly around the word "coming", but since it's so easy, we
won't do it. Nope. You won't hear us about the word "coming" at all. We also
will not refer to a putative type of birth rumored to exist.

In any case you'll also be given an enormous stock of spells by the Fairy
Godmother: [SHIFT SHAPE], [SECOND SELF], [MIMIC], [VANISH], [WERECAT],
[WEREFISH], [SHRINK], [OPEN MIND], [LOAF OF LIFE] and [POISON APPLE].

When you regain control, follow the star on your map to check on Drippy. Other
than that, there's not much to do in the village, so head back out to the world
map, then head back to your ship.

Speak to Sindbah, who is pleased to inform you that the Sea Cow has been
repaired and is ready to set sail once again. After getting aboard, several
scenes play and Drippy learns the Tidy Tears trick, sometimes performed in
battles. You also receive [THE THIRD TALE] of Wonder for your Wizard's
Companion. Better yet, a lot of errands can now be done by going back to The
Fairyground.

TIP: Now is an excellent time to metamorphose some more familiars into their
¯¯¯¯ second form if you haven't already done so. You'll gain a few levels during
     the errands that follow, but if you feel like that isn't enough, take a
     little more time off to regain most of your familiars' strength before
     proceeding with the story. Be sure to customize their tricks as they level
     up; you'll unlock plenty of useful ones.

| The fairy in the southeast corner of town has had his slapsticks stolen by   |

| Head to the world map and look for the bats near the beach area, and defeat  |

Those are all errands on Teeheeti island, but there's one other errand you can
do, it just requires you to backtrack to the Golden Grove forest. The best way
to do this is by sailing around the east side of the Summerlands continent and
disembark at the beach of the Ding Dong Dell area. This also provides you with
an excellent opportunity to give Old Father Oak a visit, who's glad to hear of
your progress and rewards you with a [MEDAL OF DEXTERITY]. You'll want to
travel to Golden Grove afterwards.

| ERRAND #053 - Boars in the Bushes |
|¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯|
| DESCRIPTION: Some hyperboars have moved in to Golden Grove, making life very |
| ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ difficult for the fairies who live there.                       |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

|                                                                              |
| The fairy at the far south area of Golden Grove asks you to deal with the    |
| horrible hyperboars who have been troubling the forest, eating its mushrooms.|
| All Hyperboars are marked on your map, making them easy to find. The first   |
| two Hyperbores are accompanied by two Crashing Boars - lesser versions which |
| you should eliminate first - while the third Hyperboar is accompanied by     |
| three of those, so you might want to touch the nearby Waystone first.        |
|                                                                              |
| The battles themselves aren't too tough if you bring familiars who can dish  |
| out fire-elemental attacks - equip your Burning Blades for sure - and group  |
| hitting attacks such as Mite's Cut Loose work rather well. It's certainly    |
| good to know that all the boars can be blinded (by skills such as Mite's     |
| Sand Blast), so it's generally a good idea to blind the strongest boar at    |
| the start of the battle and then to follow up with an all-out attack while   |
| using group hitting skills manually. Do stay healthy and use healing spells  |
| or items should anyone fall below 40% of their max HP. Once they've fallen,  |
| return to the Waystone to heal and save.                                     |
|                                                                              |
| Return to the fairy, only to find that it's being attacked by an even        |
| stronger Full Bore (along with three Crashing Boars). Proper boss battle     |
| music may roll, then en't it? There's good! Your strategy from before works  |
| equally well in this battle, except it's going to be a little longer and     |
| tougher, and you'll want to watch your health a little more closely. After   |
| defeating the boars, you're finally given a reward for all your hard labor.  |
|______________________________________________________________________________|


TIP: Out of the newly available Merit Awards, Crackerjack is probably the best
¯¯¯¯ since it increases the amount of experience you receive after battles by
     10%. Second best is Jack-o'-Lantern, which increases normal drops by 5%.

You're all set to sail to Hamelin, although there is one more stop you could
make; the optional No Longer Mine isle, which is just to the north-northeast of
Teeheeti / southeast of your destination. There are several treasures to be
found here, but the enemies, you've guessed it, will skin your hide before you
can say Wrath of the White Witch. Only the first treasure is easy to get (it's
on the beach), but the rest will definitely require you to be at full HP, MP,
guts, and have a stock of save files.

TIP: Remember that enemies on the world map can be briefly stunned by grabbing
¯¯¯¯ any item. Don't remove the item box but quickly run away to safety, giving
     you a small lead that might just save your life.

   No Longer Mine Island:
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
 • The first hidden treasure is easy (and safe) to find: inspect the lone rock
   on the beach to grab [SEE-THROUGH PIE x5].

 • The train tracks on the southwest part if the island run into a cliff.
   Inspect this location to find [RUBY RIPPLE ICE CREAM x5].

 • Follow these train track a little to the north until they fade out. Search
   the edge of the rocky cliff to find [CARNATION CAKE x5].

 • Keep following the tracks and curve around the rocks to the west. Search
   the inlet to find [BABANA FLAN x5]; this is all south of the ruined factory.

 • Head to the far west side of the island and move to the southwest corner;
   search here to find [FAIRY CHOCOLATE x5].

 • Check the (local) map of the island and head to the easternmost forest on
   the map, or better yet, slightly north-northwest of it, and search the soil
   here to find [WILDFLOWER SUNDAE x5].

 * The forage point on the north side of the island contains a nice [555 G].

When you're all done, set sail for Hamelin.

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

As usual, with a new area comes plenty of new hidden treasure to discover!

 * As soon as you disembark on the beach, you should see a forage point on the
   top of the left hill; it contains [SLUMBERNOT LEAVES].

 • Head up the hill east of the beach and go inside the ruins. You can find a
   cup of [STRONG COFFEE] at the southeastern end of the ruins, more precisely
   on the lower level where the walled path forms a dead-end.

 • Continue north until you reach a series of long tracks. From here, head
   directly west, all the way to the edge of the island. At the furthest western
   tip, move slightly south and search the cliff to find [GAUDY CLAWS], an
   excellent familiar weapon.

 • Head back to the large tracks and spot the ruined factory on the west side
   of it. Search the middle wall to find [400 G].

 * There's a forage point directly east of the ruined factory (and the large
   track) that gives [RAW STEEL].

 • Follow the southern edge of the western ravine to its far end to find a
   [SOFT SCOOP ICE CREAM].

 • Cross the ravine by walking over the long train tracks and follow the
   eastern tracks at the split. Search the spot where they hit the mountains to
   find a [DRILL SCREW].

 • Look for a factory ruin south of the previous treasure and search just south
   of the enormous chimney to find a [GAME PIE].

 • Head back to the large tracks, this time following the west split to its far
   northwest end; the mine entrance contains a [STONE-BE-GONE].

 * From here, head west-southwest to the far west side of the continent to find
   a forage point next to the ruins of an outpost; it contains a [RUMBLE NUT].

 • Just north of the former forage point is a hidden forest glade. The red chest
   contains a [LIGHTNING BOLT], an excellent spear. There's also a green chest
   to the south of the area. Finding Swaine's vantage point might be tricky;
   it's near the wall just south of the boy. Once you do find it, you'll receive
   a [PURIFYING PULSE GEM].

 • Move northwest past Hamelin to enter what is known as the Ghostly Gorge.
   Stay on the east side of the valley, but don't follow the mountain trail all
   the way to its end. Instead, look for a small cemetery and a tree just to
   the left side of the start of this narrowing path, near the ledge that would
   drop down further into the valley. Search the graves to find [600 G].

 * There's a forage point near a cemetery that is further to the west on the
   other side of the valley; it contains a [STURDY SHINBONE].

 • The cemetery directly west of the previous forage point (on the next level
   up, near the mountainside)  contains a [BASS BELL].

 * The forage point further north in Ghostly Gorge cannot be accessed yet. It
   contains [RAW STEEL], so you're not missing out on anything essential.

 * The last forage point is easy to spot and can be found at the extraction
   device just northeast of Hamelin. It holds a [SHADOWSTONE].

Once you have all that, it's time to visit the home of the next Great Sage:
Hamelin!

'——————————————————————————————————————''——————————————————————————————————————'

As soon as you enter the city, Swaine leaves the party. Follow the path to the
east and join up with him after several scenes. Head north and speak with the
guards that - who would've guessed - aren't allowing anyone in the palace. Now's
a good time to explore the city of Hamelin, and there are various errands and
bounties you can pursue as well.

Starting off in the northern area, look for a pot on the northwest side of the
street to find a [CARNATION CAKE]. The chest to the far southwest (of this
northern section of town) contains a [CONFUSION-BE-GONE], and there's also a
green chest far up the eastern building nearby. The vantage point for this chest
is slightly east of the southwesternmost street lantern; look east to spot the
chest on one of the balconies. It contains a [CLOCKWORK CLEAVER], a highly
offensive sword that reduces magic attack and accuracy but greatly boosts your
familiar's attack stat.

Directly north of this vantage point (but still in the southwest corner of the
northern part of town) one can find a pot with [30 - 60 G] inside. There's also
a blue chest in the southeast corner of this same section; it contains a
[CHEESEBURGER].

Head back to the east part of town and look for a pot in the corner opposite of
the Cawtermaster to find a [SALTED ICE CREAM or SOUR SUNDAE or SWEETIE PIE].
You can find a chest with [STRONG COFFEE] inside the Cawtermaster's building.
Be sure to buy most of the latest equipment; there are some fine pieces of
armor and weaponry among the wares. If you're short on cash, reconsider whether
you want to buy the latest ax or craft your own (which is better, but does
require a lot of ingredients - see below). The same applies for the Grunt Armor
(although it does grant a nice attack bonus).

Here are some useful items you may want to make with alchemy:

Watchmaker's Ax =    Iron Ax + Sprocket
Clockwork Ax =       Watchmaker's Ax + Drill Screw + Sprocket
Bone Mail =          Bass Bell + Sturdy Shinbone x2
Medal of Dexterity = Soldier's Sword + Bass Bell + Sprocket

Definitely chat with with man outside Swift Solutions to receive a large amount
of alchemy formulas: 003, 009, 011, 014, 019, 024, 029, 034, 039, 058, 078, 100,
116 and 122. There is also a pot just to the west of Swift Solutions with an
[ICED COFFEE] inside.

Make sure to also chat with Horace, who's looking over the town from the balcony
near the Hootique. The answer to his new riddle can be found on pages 212-213
of the Wizard's Companion, and the number of automata familiars is of course 5.
Give him the answer and he'll reward you with the [CHART CHESTS] spell, which
marks unfound chests and treasures in dungeons and towns (but not on the world
map, unfortunately).

There are a few more pots you haven't found yet, so go ahead and cast the chart
chests spell to locate them more easily. There's one next to the Cat's Cradle
on the right side that contains a [CURSE-BE-GONE], and heading down the west
path of town makes you run into the remaining pots, which holds [30 - 60 G] and
a [BABANA FLAN] respectively (the last one is on the left side of the stairs
around the corner). Lastly, check out the Hootique to find a chest with a
[NIX-BE-GONE] item inside.

TIP: Now's also a good time to collect two pieces of heart in the main street/
¯¯¯¯ northern section of Hamelin; enthusiasm (northwest at main street), and
     restraint (southwest at main street). Also, make a quick stop at the Cat's
     Cradle to receive the [AUTUMNIA] pages for your Wizard's Companion.

With all of those treasures out of the way, time to take on some tasks at Swift
Solutions!

| The researcher's perils are not yet over, it seems! Pirates in the sea       |
| between Hamelin and Castaway Cove are preventing him to bring his medicine   |

| Finding the pirate ships is easy; make sure you initiate each fight by       |
| approaching the back of their ships to get the upper hand. An All-Out Attack |
| should make it possible for you to wipe out at least one of the three to     |
| four Zomboatswains you're up against. The last fight also includes a tougher |
| Cap'n Zombo, so pay closer attention to your health and start using group    |
| attacks. You might want to rest in the Cat's Cradle (in Castaway Cove)       |
| between battles if you get severely hurt; otherwise these battles are        |
| manageable.                                                                  |

When you're done with any errands and bounties you wanted to complete, head to
the black market in the southwest corner of the city. Talk to the man inside,
and you'll receive four suits of [HAMELIN ARMOR]. With it, you'll be able to use
it to sneak past the palace guards to the far north, so make your way there now.

Inside the palace you'll have to sneak past several guards, which is easier
than it looks.

          Start

Following the above map, perform the following steps:

NOTE: Guards can only see half a hall at a time, and cannot spot you in alcoves.
¯¯¯¯¯
1. Look to the east, spotting the guard making his way to the left and right.
   As he moves away - while at the same time the guard up north is also moving
   away from you, run up to, and hide in the northern alcove.

2. As the guard passes, make your way to the center of the area, following the
   guard patrolling the central hall, but stop at the corner.

3. At the corner, make sure the guard in the hall to the northwest isn't looking
   your direction, then make your way to the southern hall where you can hide
   just around the corner.

4. When the guard in the easternmost hall moves north, follow him to hide in the
   alcove in the northeast of the area.

5. As both the guard in the east and northern halls move away from you, quickly
   make a run for the exit nearby.

Before you drop down the manhole, it is wise to review what your familiars are
equipped with. The next boss is weak against storm based attacks, but resists
physical damage. You have at least one familiar capable of exploiting this
weakness (Drongo), but you might have more (Dumbelemur at level 25+). In any
case, equipping your Mite with a Roc Feather is a good idea, even if it drops
its attack somewhat. The Lightning Bolt is by far the best spear to equip for
this battle.

When you're absolutely ready, drop down and get ready for a tough boss.

| BOSS FIGHT: PORCO GROSSO |
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  STATS:   2540 HP, Weak against: Storm, Resists: Physical
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯
  ATTACKS: 1. Hog Roast [Range, Medium Damage]
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ 2. Road Hog [Direct Line, Medium Damage]
           3. Porco Salvo [Single Target, Medium to Major Damage,
                           Use Defend + All-Out Defense!]
           4. Gammon Cannon [Single Target, Major Damage, Used when its HP
                             falls below 30%, Use Defend + All-Out Defense,
                             Heal party beforehand]

  REWARDS: 1130 EXP, 1630 G, Hog's Cog
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Porco Grosso is Hamelin's toughest enemy and physical attacks are basically
harmless against it, so you'll mostly want to stick with magic and tricks.
Mostly - because equipping Mite with the Roc Feather, and any spear-using
familiars with a Lightning Bolt is a good idea, allowing them to do at least
a little more damage with regular physical attacks.

Nonetheless, your Drongo will play an important role in this battle, as will any
other familiars with storm-based tricks. Definitely perform an All-Out attack
when the boss is weakened, and have Oliver grab the golden glim to perform his
Burning Heart attack, which always deals decent damage.

Keep your health up by using Sandwiches and healing spells, and if things are
going smooth, have Swaine steal the boss's Tower Toppler, which you might've
already bought from the Cawtermaster, but it's a good and valuable piece of
equipment nonetheless.

When the boss drops below 30% of its HP, it will start using a powerful attack
called Gammon Cannon. This generally deals above 100 points of damage, so
healing your party right before its HP drops to 30%, followed up with an
All-Out defense plus Defend command is a wise move. If someone gets knocked out,
do consider reviving them with a Phoenix Feather, heal them back up, then finish
the battle with a few All-Out attacks.

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Whenever you have control, just make your way to the stars for cutscenes. After
a few of them, you'll  be magically transported to the Hamelin of the past. More
scenes will play until  you're finally required to investigate a mine where the
Emperor's young princes have gone. Visit the Cat's Cradle to heal up (if
necessary), then go to the world map and check out the mine located in the
mountains southeast of Hamelin.

You'll find Gascin and Marcassin (the Emperor's sons) under attack by a giant
Earth Ogrrr. The beast is easily taken care of, so have Gascin 'escort' you back
to the castle afterwards. You'll be given the [ARROW OF LIGHT] spell, which
deals light elemental damage and is particularly effective against undead/dark
enemies.

With that spell and knowledge you have now, it's time to leave Hamelin and
depart for your next destination... once you're ready, of course.

________________________________________________________________________________

Travel through the Ghostly Gorge to the northwest of Hamelin and use your Bridge
spell to close the gap that was previously blocked by a Hamelin Boar, who
must've gotten boared by standing there all day. Be sure to collect the hidden
treasure at the graves in the far northeast corner to find a [MIRRORED ARMOR].
The Tombstone Trail can be entered on the far north side by traveling underneath
the bridge you just crafted.

As you enter you'll receive the [ROGUE'S REVOLVER FORMULA (128)], so be sure to
craft one for Swaine if you have the ingredients. It's important to know that
there are Curse Traps lying around this area; dark spots that inflict the curse
status ailment on Oliver and his friends, which slows them down significantly
both in the field and in battles. It only lasts several seconds, but enemies
can easily catch up with you during this time. It's best to altogether avoid
the dark cursed spots by casting the Levitate spell to float over them.

Take the right path (the left branch leads to a dead end with a Curse Trap) -
ignoring the double doors for now - until you reach a broken bridge. Cast
Bridge, right? Nope! Ah.. Levitate right over it then, huh!? Nope! Only the
Rejuvenate spell allows you to continue. In any case, collect a handy [CURSE-BE-
GONE] from the chest to the right of the bridge and continue climbing the trail.

At the intersection, head over the wooden plank to collect a [CHEESEBURGER] from
the chest at the far end (but be sure to avoid or levitate over the Curse Trap
near the graves). Mr. Skeleton at the end of the other path isn't about to let
you though so give him a whoop... Actually, cast the Poison Apple spell when
Oliver has the '?' mark above his head and you'll fake your way through. You'll
also receive the [SKELETON KEY] which will soon grant you access to the Crypt
Casino.

You'll be at a three-way intersection; the lower left path contains a green
chest with a [BLACK BLADE]. The upper left path leads to a dead and with a Curse
Trap, so take the middle path leading west to proceed. After running for quite a
long time, you'll reach a shack with a nearby Waystone; after the scene, you can
collect a [CURSE-BE-GONE] from the pot hidden behind the shack. Take note of the
broken robot and continue onwards.

The path will get rather dark at some point, so cast the Magic Lamp spell to
light the way for you, and be sure to cast this spell whenever you see candles
along the path to provide you with a more permanent light. In fact, it is a
requirement to light all seven unlit candles in this area before you can
continue.

The path splits here; the one to the northwest has a chest at its end that
contains a [MISTY SHROUD] and an unlit candle, while the other dead end to the
far west has just an unlit candle. Head back to the intersection, cast the
Levitate spell and take the right trail, which will once again split up. Before
you reach the intersection, be sure to light the three unlit candles along the
way, the last one being in an alcove to the east.

There's a chest with an [AVENGER'S BADGE] at the end of the northwest trail, as
well as the final unlit candle, clearing the rock wall to the east. Recast
Levitate (if necessary) and search behind the tree in the northeast corner to
find a blue chest with a [DEVIL'S FANG].

Heal up at the Waystone up ahead and save your game before diving into the next
boss fight.

  STATS:   3130 HP, Weak against: Light, Resists: Fire, Dark
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯   Steal: Noble Attire

  ATTACKS: 1. Physical Attack [One Target, Minor Damage]
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ 2. Boo! [All Targets, Minor Damage, Inflicts Curse]
           3. Snuff Out [All Targets, Inflicts Blindness]
           4. Wacko Lantern [All Targets, Medium to Major Damage]

  REWARDS: 1290 EXP, 1750 G
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Candelabracadabra is a surprisingly easy boss to beat, but that's mostly thanks
to your newly acquired Arrow of Light spell, which tends to generate various
glims - including golden ones - so be sure to cast the spell a lot by using
Oliver.

Its physical attacks are swift and the other attacks can inflict Curse and
Blindness on you and your familiars, although it shouldn't make too much of a
difference. What you'll really want to look out for is its Wacko Lantern attack,
which hits all party members for a decent amount of damage. Be sure to quickly
perform an All-Out Defense when you see Candel cast this.

If you have the battle under control, definitely steal the Noble Attire from it,
an excellent cloak for one of your familiars.

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Afterward, you'll finally be able to claim the [MORNSTAR] as your own, and a
clue is given to you as to how you managed to travel back in time. Return to
Hamelin by using the nearby teleport. As you travel back, a scene plays, and
even more scenes will play when you reach the Emperor. After all this, collect
a piece of belief from young Marcassin and cast the [BREACH TIME] spell you've
gotten just now. In the present, cure Marcassin and he'll grant you the [WARD],
[FUSE], [INSIGHT] and [TRAVEL] spells, the latter being extremely handy as it
allows you to teleport to any places you've already visited.

TIP: Make sure to actually equip Mornstar, if you haven't already. It gives you
¯¯¯¯ a nice magic boost!

visit, explore, pursue or complete. Here's a handy list of all things that you
can currently undertake:

 • Revisit Old Father Oak to visit a [HEALING TEAR GEM] plus a page in your
   Wizard's Companion, [THE ELEVENTH TALE] of Wonder.

 • Errands #012 - #018, #077, #082, and Bounties #098 - #102 have opened up.
   You can also complete Errand #008 (from the Fairyground, which you had to
   leave open for now). See below for details on the errands.

 • You can visit the Crypt Casino at the Tombstone Trail. There are various
   prizes you can buy with your Chips, but the Crownberries and Big Babana, as
   well as the Bluster Blade are currently the most worthy of your efforts. The
   first two alchemy items are used to create the most powerful treats, while
   the blade is quite decent storm-based sword for this moment in the game.

 • You can revisit Sage Solomon at the Temple of Trials and participate in the
   Solosseum, in which you fight various consecutive battles. For now, Rank E is
   most likely the best you can manage. It helps to equip a Burning Blade for
   this rank, or use familiars with fire-based abilities. You'll have to fight
   three battles; order Oliver and Swaine not to use any abilities in the first
   battle, heal with Esther while having them perform All-Out attacks on the
   enemy and kill the Ruffian first. The second battle can be fought the same
   way, but spare one creature in order to heal up for the tougher third round.
   Focus on a single enemy (and allow Oliver and Swaine to use abilities this
   time), such as the Danglerfish. With only two enemies left, heal your party
   and swiftly take them out one by one with All-Out attacks. You'll be rewarded
   with a [DRAGON TUSK] and [2000 G].

   NOTE: After your first win, you'll receive the 'Solosseum Slugger' trophy.
   ¯¯¯¯¯
   TIP: Normally Rank D will be too tough for you to handle at this point in the
   ¯¯¯¯ game, but if you level up a lot on Ugly Duckling Island (see below,
        under Autumnia Islands Exploration) then you should be able to tackle
        it nonetheless. The reward is a [HOT-BLOODED BADGE] and [5000 G].

 • The islands surrounding Autumnia can be explored. This was already possible,
   but you're much better prepared now. Below are more details.

 • Now's also a good time to explore the islands southwest of the Summerlands.
   (You may want to read below before sailing there, to save you from having to
   make several trips there and back, gathering supplies.)

   There are plenty of items and mini-sidequests to be done there, and the
   westernmost island of the bunch (The Hermit's Shell) also has a forage point
   that gives a [METEORITE FRAGMENT]. If you've collected one of these (from
   here) before, you can now make the excellent Barrier Badge (Iron Shield +
   Meteorite Fragment x2 + Sprocket x2]. It grants +15 defense and magic defense
   while lowering evasion and accuracy by 5 points.

   The cave on this island is filled with familiars that you can speak to with
   Nature's Tongue. There are five mini-quests to be done here:

   1. The Naiads want two Carnation Cakes and a Carrot Cake. Your reward is a
      [SAGE'S SECRET]. (The Cakes are easily made through alchemy.)

   2. There's a Clinketyclank who wants three Sprockets. Be sure to first craft
      the Barrier Badge (see right above), since that takes an absolute priority
      in terms of rewards. You can collect any further Sprockets from Sprog Cogs
      in the southern parts of Autumnia; either steal them or wait for a drop.
      Your reward will be a [THUNDERSPARK GEM].

   3. The Puss in Boats want two Well-Worn Swords. You can simply buy these from
      the Cawtermaster in Ding Dong Dell. Your reward is a [POISON PINCH GEM].

   4. Mister Jackpotty wants to meet a fellow familiar. Catching a potty is
      possible by fighting them at sea nearby Shipwreck Shore, southeast of the
      Shimmering Sands. The reward for this is [PIXIE DEW x3].

   5. The Duncecap has a similar request. It wants to meet a fellow mushroom
      familiar. Catch one in Golden Grove if you don't have one and bring it
      back; the reward are [GLOWCAPS x5].

      If you fulfill all five requests, you'll also get the [NAME TAG] from the
      Tokotoko (just speak with it), which allows you to rename any of your
      familiars. J-RPG classic!

Of course you can also set sail to find Kublai, in which case you'll need to
travel to the northeast part of the Summerlands continent, toward the Skull
Mountain.


   Autumnia Islands Exploration:
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
 • The isle east of Autumnia is called The Spindle, and its inhabitants are
   fairly strong. You can only partially explore the island at this time, but
   there's a hidden treasure that can be found nonetheless. Move around the
   rocks to the south and search the westernmost cliff to collect a [PIXIE DEW].

   Unfortunately, the island to the northeast of Autumnia - The Broken Crown -
   cannot be accessed by the Sea Cow, as it has no beaches. Note it for later.

 • Of much more interest are the islands northwest of Autumnia. The largest
   island is known as Swan Island and you'll meet some 'familiar' faces there
   (Mite, Thumbelemur, Drongo, Seed Sprite). The first hidden treasure on Swan
   Island is easy to find: move south from the beach and search the base of the
   mountains right between two small forests to find [SUNDROP x2].

 • Still on Swan Island, follow the northeast trail to its end and search the
   northernmost point of this area for [500 G]. Not bad!

 * There's also a useful forage point on the west side of Swan Island that nets
   you [FOGDROP], an ingredient used in several alchemy formulas.

 • Visit the small island west of Swan Island and walk over the beach to the
   tiny adjacent isle. Search the south area to collect [BABANA FLAN x2].

 • The small island west of Swan Island contains a hidden treasure itself;
   search the northernmost tip of it to find a [CAPPUCINO].

 * The island south of Swan Island is called Ugly Duckling Isle. The forage
   point here contains an [ANGULA].

 • The northernmost tip of the Ugly Duckling Isle contains [RUBY RIPPLE ICE
   CREAM x2].

   TIP: Ugly Duckling Island is home to a fairly uncommon creature known as
   ¯¯¯¯ Toko; green and round staff-wielding cowards. You can encounter them
        on the world map but also as part of other enemy teams (but only on this
        island). Since they give a whooping 2000 EXP points, this is an amazing
        place to level your characters up into their late 30's, early 40's even.
        It's also a good idea to metamorphose some of your familiars into their
        third form, since it only takes a couple of battles to have them back
        at their former strength. You'll ALWAYS want to take out Toko's first,
        and preferably approach enemies from their backs to give you a slight
        advantage; Toko's tend to run away quickly. Powerful skills combined
        with an All-Out attack (+ attack leader's target) should counter this.

 • You can also visit the northwest part of Autumnia by disembarking at the
   western beach of the continent, which gives access to a mountain trail with
   very powerful enemies. If you've levelled up to around level 40 (for your
   characters) you should be able to defeat them, but not without difficulty,
   so it's better to avoid any enemies here for now. If you want to take a risk
   for a rather decent treasure, save your game on the beach and head to the
   far end of the trail. Search the area northeast of the stone at the end to
   find a [PHOENIX BREATH] item, which has the power to revive your entire party
   to full health and is supremely useful in the final dungeon(s).

 * There's also a forage point at the end of this mountain trail that holds
   a [SUN CRYSTAL or STAR CRYSTAL or MOON CRYSTAL or PLANET CRYSTAL], items used
   in alchemy.

| want to use some attack-boosting skills such as Mite's War Cry. Pummel away, |

________________________________________________________________________________

When you're done exploring the world and running errands for nearly every NPC
in the game, set sail for the beach on the northwest side of the Summerlands
continent. You might want to collect a few hidden treasures, but other than
those, the path to the pirates' den is straightforward; simply head north.

 • There are some forests on the cliffs directly right/south of the beach.
   Search the southern soil of the westernmost cliff nearby some trees to find
   a [CAPPUCCINO].

 * You'll come across a forage point as you follow the trail to the (north)east;
   it contains a [DRILL SCREW].

 • To the far east of the trail are two very large boulders; check them to find
   a [STARDROP].

 • Cross the nearby river to reach the northern section of the area. Search the
   rocks to the northwest close to a waterfall to find [500 G].

Once you've picked up all of the treasures, proceed the rest of the way up the
hill to enter Skull Mountain itself.

Watch the scene after you're inside, then use the Waystone to recover and save.
There's a boss battle coming up, so if you can, equip whatever weapons you have
on your physical attackers that have the Water or Storm attribute, as it'll help
immensely. When you're ready, board the airship for a few scenes, then take on
the boss!

 ________________________
| BOSS FIGHT: RED DRAGON |
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  STATS:   4350 HP, Weak against: Water, Storm, Resists: Fire
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯   Steal: Dragon Tusk

  ATTACKS: 1. Dragon Scales [Self, Boosts Magic Defense]
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ 2. Dragonbreath [Range, Minor Damage, Leaves trails of Fire behind]
           3. Firestream [Line, Medium to Major Damage, Use Defend!]

  REWARDS: 1470 EXP, 2050 G
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Before the battle gets too far underway, quickly switch to Swaine and steal that
Dragon Tusk! It's a pretty decent weapon, and if you try it at the beginning and
fail, then you can always reload your save for a better shot.

Once you have it, then switch to your most powerful physical attackers and sick
them on the Red Dragon. It'll cast Dragon Scales right away, which will raise
its magic defense quite a bit, making anything but normal attacks practically
useless.

Its Dragonbreath attack isn't very threatening, but it does leave behind trails
of fire on the field, damaging all who happen to step into them, so try to avoid
them if at all possible. As for Firestream, he'll take a few seconds to charge
up before letting it loose, so switch to the character he's aiming at and Defend
with them if possible to avoid some major damage.

After a while, Drippy will hop in and tell you that you need to poison it, so
keep an eye on the icon near its name in the upper right corner of the screen,
and when that magic defense boost wears off, QUICKLY switch to Swaine and have
him blast the beast with his Rotshot to inflict poison. With that, you'll also
have a chance to do some major damage, so use the All-Out Attack! command and
continue firing Rotshot with Swaine to deal the hurt. Repeat this every time his
guard drops, and he'll be down in no time.

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

After the battle, you'll learn of your next destination, but you can only make
it there via a dragon. The only problem is the one that can do it needs to be
healed first. Always something, huh?

Talk to the pirate on the lower right deck, and he'll give you quite a few new
formulae: 015, 020, 025, 030, 035, 040, 070, 079, 087, 090, 103, 111, and 124.
After grabbing those, go to the eastern part of the cave and check out Tengri.
Use your 'Native Tongue' spell to determine what's wrong with the ailing dragon.
After talking to Tengri, go back and talk to Kublai to tell him your plan, and
you'll receive a [JUMBO SUNDROP], as well as formula 043 to make them yourself!

When you're ready, stop at the Waystone to recover and save, then cast 'Gateway'
and head back over to Motorville!


To Motorville
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
After you finally regain control, head just to your left and talk to Myrtle for
a bit. A dog will come in, trying to get your attention; 'Nature's Tongue' is
your friend again here, so use it to finally understand the whole situation,
then make your way to the southeast end of town to the house next to Myrtle's.
Talk to the dog, Genghis, once again, and watch the scenes unfold. Yikes,
another boss fight!!!

| BOSS FIGHT: DENNY'S NIGHTMARE |
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  STATS:   3850 HP, Weak against: Light, Resists: Dark
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯

  ATTACKS: 1. Physical Attack [Single Target, Minor Damage]
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ 2. Restless Sleep [All Allies, Inflicts Sleep, try to cancel!]
           3. Oil Spill [All Allies, Major Damage, Use Defend and
                         All-Out Defense!]
  REWARDS: 1565 EXP, 2200 G
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Being an undead-looking demon, the Nightmare is naturally weak to Light, so you
would think spamming Arrow of Light would be a good idea. Granted, it does work
nicely, but because of its high MP cost and only being able to do it
occasionally, you'll be better off switching to one of your more powerful
attackers to do the majority of your damage. That, and you may have an easier
time cancelling some of his attacks if you're constantly barraging him.

His Restless Sleep attack is largely an annoyance; not that it does any damage,
but sleeping characters are defenseless characters. Once the attack is done,
quickly use Sleep-Be-Gones on those who are affected. Oil Spill, on the other
hand, is quite a nasty attack, and needs to be Defended at all costs. It'll hit
EVERYONE in your party for anywhere between 80 and 100 HP each, so as soon as
you see it coming, quickly switch to an All-Out Defense! and choose to Defend
whomever you're controlling until it's over, then quickly heal afterward.

Other than avoiding Oil Spill, be sure to keep Esther's MP at a decent level so
she can continuously heal everyone while you blast into the Nightmare.

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

With that Nightmare out of the way, we now need to find some confidence for poor
Denny. Sadly, there's none here in Motorville, so use 'Gateway' and head back to
the other world.


Back to Skull Mountain
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Luckily, you need not go far to get some confidence. Talk to Kublai, and you'll
be able to get a drop from him. He'll also give you the spells [QUAKE] and [SEEK
FORTUNE]. With Seek Fortune, you'll now be able to see hidden treasure on the
World Map! About time! Cast 'Gateway' once again and return to Motorville.


To Motorville again
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Run on over to Denny and give him a hunk of confidence, then follow Myrtle back
to Leila's store to run into Pea, who brings warnings to Oliver. In any case,
you're finished here, so head back to Skull Mountain once again.


Back to Skull Mountain again
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Head back to the airship and talk to Kublai. Watch the scenes here as you'll
finally be able to ride the large purple dragon as you please! You'll
automatically hop onto Tengri and head off onto the World Map.

NOTE: You'll automatically earn the 'Fly the Friendlier Skies' trophy once you
¯¯¯¯¯ are able to fly with Tengri.

Pay attention to Drippy's tutorial on how to fly, then you'll receive the
[DRAGON HORN] that will let you summon Tengri anywhere on the world map! Now,
it's off to Solitary Isle, which is on the southeastern corner of your map; take
a look! On this small island, read the text on the stone and search behind it
for a [THUNDERSTORM GEM]. Summon Tengri afterwards with the directional 'Up'
button and return to Kublai.

After the scene, cast the 'Insight' spell to reveal the three locations of the
stones. You'll be given the [MAP OF THE STONES] for free by Kublai. Now that you
can explore the world map almost entirely, its smart to collect several hidden
treasures and complete new errands.

Now that you have Tengri, almost all of Ni no Kuni's world map has opened up for
you. In addition, various new errands and bounties can now be completed, and
it's also that time of the year again as well: visit Old Father Oak to receive a
[GREEN MAN'S CLOAK] from him. Furthermore, most hidden treasures can now be
obtained (see below), and interesting ingredients can be gotten from previously
inaccessible areas. Let's start with the errands and bounties first.

Hidden Treasures Exploration:
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
There are many hidden treasures to be found now that you've claimed the sky as
your own. Keep in mind that some areas are teeming with tough enemies.

TIP: You can now use the 'Seek Treasure' spell to reveal any nearby hidden
¯¯¯¯ treasures on your local map. Be sure to use it during what follows!


   Northern Summerlands:
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
 * Have Tengri land on the previously inaccessible flat stone hill to the
   southeast of Deep Dark Wood and search the forage point for a [JADE MARBLE].

 * There's also a forage point to the far north of the area, stashed away among
   some forests just south of the northermost mountains. It can give a variety
   of four ingredients, all with a 25% chance: [PLAINSWORT FLOWER or ANGULA or
   GNOMEBEARD or RINGS-A-BELL].

 * Locate the large lake and waterfall just northwest of the Deep Dark Wood.
   The forage point directly to the west side of the waterfall (nearby a
   singular tree) contains a [WETSTONE]. 

 * You can find a fourth and final forage point on the eastern side of the
   northern plains. It's located between two single bones sticking out of the
   ground and aptly gives a [STURDY SHINBONE].


   West Coast of the Summerlands (south of Skull Mountain):
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
   This area is known as The Barrens and is only accessible with Tengri, since
   it is separated from other areas by mountains.
   
 • There's a little hill amongst forests on the west side of the Barrens. Search
   its top to find a [THUNDERSPARK GEM].

 * South of here, search the southernmost cliff (which sticks out a little bit
   more in the sea than the rest) to locate a forage point that gives a [JADE
   MARBLE]

 * There's another hill on the east side of The Barrens that gives [FOGDROP].

 • Directly south of this hill, search the corner of the lower cliffs to find
   a [POISONER'S HORN].


   Russet Isle: 
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
   This is the stretched island west of The Barrens (and the Summerlands
   continent). If you haven't been leveling up lately, the enemies can be fairly
   tough, so you might want to save your game beforehand to see if you can
   tackle them. A level 40 party can surely handle them, though.

 • Have Tengri drop you off on the beach on the eastern part of the island. The
   northeastern tip of the island has a [SLOW POKE GEM].

 • Just to the west close to the center of the island is another offshoot;
   search the edge of its north end to find [STURDY SHINBONE x3].

 • The hidden forest glade is located in the large forest on the     | |
   island's west side (it's partly surrounded by a raised edge).     |T|
   Inside are three chests (although you can't collect the          /   \
   contents of the purple one yet). The green chest is well        |     |
   hidden; it's located far above the tunnel entrance. To find     | o   |
   the vantage point, stand on the left/west side of the area,     /     \
   standing with roughly equal distance from the small grass
   circles to the north and south. It contains a [PHOENIX BREATH].
   Up north, the regular red chest contains a [TOADSTOOL SUNDAE].


   The Shimmering Sands Plateaus:
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
   The northern plateaus were all previously inaccessible, and one part of the
   southern plateaus with a treasure was also impossible to reach until now.
   We'll cover the northern plateaus first.

 • This one's easy to locate. Have Tengri drop you off at the westernmost tip
   of the plateaus and search the west edge to find [MILK CHOCOLATE x10].

 * If you look at your world map (or local map) you'll notice that the plateaus
   stretch out a little to the south. There are two such plateaus surrounding
   the Temple of Trials and there's a third one to the left/west of those. This
   forage point can be found at the southern tip of this third/western plateau
   and it contains a [BASS BELL].

 * This forage point is located on the plateau that stretches and surrounds the
   Temple of Trials on its east side. Its exact location is on the left/west
   side of this eastern plateau; it holds a [JADE MARBLE].

 • There's a large oval plateau north of the Temple of Trials, with some lower
   plains directly below it. Land on the western lower plains and curve around
   the southwest of the large plateau until you reach a dead end (very close
   to the actual temple). Search the ground here to find a [FIREWALL GEM].

 • Land on the northeasternmost plateau and curve around the edge to the west
   to find a [NOBLE ATTIRE].

 • As for the southern plateau, simply land on the easternmost tip of the
   *western* plateau (this part was previously inaccessible). Search this tip -
   which is adjacent to the passageway towards Castaway Cove - to find a [BREEZE
   CAKE].


   The Alchemist's Cave:
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
 • This cave is located on the southernmost section of the plateaus southeast
   of the Summerlands. Inside you'll find a blue chest with a [MEDAL OF
   FORTITUDE] inside. There's also a purple chest that you can't open yet, and
   the man will offer to learn you new formulae after you've beaten the game
   and come back during post-gameplay.


   No Longer Mine Island:
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
 • Since you've already gotten the Thunderstone Gem from Solitary Isle (as
   described in the walkthrough above; the island where you landed Tengri to
   learn about the three magic stones), all that's left to do around this part
   of the world is to land on the small, heavily forested island directly south
   of No Longer Mine Island (which is, you'll remember, south of Autumnia).
   There is, of course, a hidden forest glade here with a green and purple
   chest, along with a hilarious dialogue. The green chest is located in the
   northeast part of the forest glade, but the vantage point for claiming its
   contents is directly to the north of the man, while facing east/northeast.
   Opening it grants you a [DRAGON TUSK].


   The Spindle & Broken Crown Isles (east of Autumnia):
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
 * The island directly east of Autumnia - The Spindle as you'll recall - has a
   clearly visible forage point on its northeastern erected tip. No, we did not
   mean anything by that. It contains a [JADE MARBLE].

 • You can find a [WOODSMAN'S KNIFE] by searching the far northeastern edge of
   The Spindle.

 * Visiting the Broken Crown Isle, note the forage point north of the forests;
   it contains a [RUMBLENUT].

 • From the inscribed stone in the center of the island, move straight south and
   search the mountain walls for a [SKULLFANG RING].
 
 • Head up the northeastern mountain trail and search the dead end up north to
   find a [BEE STING], an excellent spear for your familiars at this point of
   the game.


   Hidden Mine (far east of Hamelin):
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
 * If you follow the eastern mountains of Autumnia, you'll soon enough reach a
   trail with a mine, some minor tracks, and a forage point at the end that
   contains a [PLAINSWORT FLOWER].

 • The cave contains a regular chest with a [TOADSTOOL SUNDAE], but its real
   prize is an extremely well hidden green chest at the other end, where the
   skeleton hermit is located. Since it's so dark, use your Magic Lamp spell
   and ... Oh, wait. How silly of me; that was - naturally - not meant to be
   used in dark places like this. Instead, have Swaine stand on the elevated
   ground between the two barrels and have him shoot slightly above looking
   distance; the crosshair will light up when your aim's correct. Inside the
   chest is a [GIANT'S FINGERNAILS], which is only decent because of its big
   accuracy boost.


   Leveling Up with Tokotokos:
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
   Northeast of Hamelin and the Ghostly Gorge lies a green valley with to its
   far east a city called Perdida. You can visit the place but you'll be halted
   by a guard at the entrance for now. The good part is that this valley is
   home to the Tokotoko creatures - the evolved version of the Toko that you
   may have battled at Ugly Duckling Island - and they give a whopping 8000 EXP
   a piece (and sometimes even appear twice in a single enemy group)!
   
   The other foes in this area are rather strong, so you might want to level up
   at Ugly Duckling Island first, but if you want to risk it, here's an
   excellent way to almost guarantee a fight with a Tokotoko.
   
   Have Tengri drop you off at the city of Perdida and save your game. Scan the
   nearby path to see if the first enemy is a Tokotoko (green creature with a
   small staff). If not, enter the city and return to the world map until it is.
   Now be very careful with approaching it; if it sees you it'll definitely run
   away. Stand at a reasonable distance so that it cannot spot you, but also not
   not too far away so you can quickly catch it. When it starts walking towards
   you, prepare yourself to sprint towards it as soon as it turns its back. If
   you're quick, you should be able to catch it off guard.
   
   In the battle, focus solely on the Tokotoko before doing anything else, and
   start with an All-Out Attack. Quickly switch to Swaine - more specifically
   his Hurly - and perform a Sling Stone trick on the Tokotoko (while your
   tactics should be set so that the others 'Give their all' and attack the
   leader's target). A flurry of attack should do the trick, but there's always
   a chance that they'll escape nonetheless, since they're incredibly chicken.

   Note that later on (when you progress the story enough to reach Perdida),
   you'll get the 'Veil' spell that allows you to sneak up on enemies, making
   leveling here somewhat easier.


Those were almost all optional errands, bounties and treasures at this points.
Should you be ready to continue, you'll have to choose between three different
locations. You can do these in any order you want, but in terms of difficulty
(easier to harder) you might want to follow the order of this walkthrough.

________________________________________________________________________________

Remember Shipwreck Shore, southeast of the Shimmering Sands, but north of the
Crusoe Islands? The Vault of Tears is located here; it's the area you previously
couldn't access. Turns out that it was for the better...

There's a Waypoint and magic circle at the start of the area (as well as a
Familiar Retreat). Head down the stairs until a short scene plays and the party
is turned into frogs. Your familiars can thankfully still be used in battle, as
can provisions.

Since the water stream is too strong on the left side, proceed east and follow
the rainbow colored frog downstairs. Don't bother trying to open chests, since
frogs obviously can't open them. Turn left twice (heading into the northern
room) and wade through the water to reach a room west of the flooded chamber.
Looks like the rainbow frog is headed south, so follow it upstairs and step
inside the magic circle to turn back to normal again. The nearby chest contains
an [ESPRESSO].

Now head north to find the rainbow frog; use 'Nature's Tongue' to speak with it,
then proceed north to find Prince Ali in a cell. Use the 'Spring Lock' spell to
free him, and make note of the Waystone here. After all the scenes, head back to
the magic circle, and after that, to the northern room with the gate. The prince
only has a partial clue; the full clue can be found in his cell. Stand in the
middle of the room with the gate, then cast the 'Puppet String' spell. Now, swap
the two statues so that each one is standing exactly where the other was
standing. Don't push them all the way to the back or they won't align correctly.
If done successfully, the water in the flooded room is lowered.

Heading south first, you can curve around the western hallway to return to the
first walkway where you were turned to stone. From here, head east to the room
just south of the formerly flooded area to collect some treasures. 

TIP: Whatever you do, DO NOT walk in front of the statue from the start of the
¯¯¯¯ area again. Otherwise, you'll be back to frogs and have to trek all the way
     back around to the magic circle to undo it.

There's a blue chest underneath some vines in the lower right/southeast corner
of the room that contains a [PIE ON THE BONE]. If you want to collect the
treasure to the south, cast Levitate first - there are Nix Traps on either side
of the walkway that you'll want to avoid. The chest contains a [SAGE'S SECRET].

Head inside the previously flooded room to the north of the area and look for a
green chest behind the bars to the north; it contains [STORM SERPENT SCALES].
The star on your map indicates the [SERPENT KEY], which is located in a blue
chest blocked by a Nix Trap, so use Levitate to get past it, followed by using
Spring Lock.

There's only one treasure left to get. Use the pillars as stepping stones (they
are on the east side of the room, upstairs) and cast Levitate (if it has worn
off) to get past the Nix Trap. The end of this walkway contains a chest with a
[GREEN MAN'S CLOAK]. Having done all this, return to Prince Ali. It's best to
save your game at the nearby Waystone, since by the rules of the JRPG, we sense
a boss battle approaching! Equipping your familiars with storm-resisting armor
and cloaks is a wise move, and fire dealing weapons and familiars with fire
tricks are good to deploy in the upcoming battle.

When you're ready, use the key on the door on the left side of the room, then
enter the Chamber of Secrets to take on Lord Voldemort's Basilisk! (Er, wait,
wrong magical universe.)

           3. Black Bolt [Single Target, Inflicts Confusion, use Defend!]
           4. Serpent Strike [Targets in front of Aapep, use Defend!]

  REWARDS: 1730 EXP, 2450 G
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Aapep has some decent tricks up his sleeve, but if you've come prepared you
should have fair defenses. The Death Rattle and Black Bolt attacks both inflict
status ailments, curse and confusion respectively. Definitely try to avoid or
defend against Black Bolt. If Curse really annoys you, use a few Curse-Be-Gones
or otherwise bear with the status.

Since Aapep is weak against fire and light, you could use spells like Arrow of
Light to your advantage, although it's not absolutely necessary. When Drippy
tells gives you his ever-wise advise, cast the Burden spell with Oliver (several
times, until it sticks), and perform an All-Out attack afterwards. If Burden
generates golden glims, quickly grab them (with Oliver or familiars with a fire
Miracle Move).

Serpent Strike is a powerful attack, so try to avoid it or defend against it;
the storm-resisting equipment will also come in handy here. If you're confident
enough, try to cancel some of Aapep's attacks by continuously going All-Out on
him.

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Various scenes play after the battle, and you're of course rewarded with the
long sought [MOON STONE]. A new page in your Wizard's Companion is also yours:
[THE FOURTH TALE] of Wonder!

With that in hand, you'll regain control outside of Al Mamoon. Rest up at the
Cat's Cradle there, head back out and get ready to find the next stone!

Before doing anything, make sure that you take the time to equip your familiars
with weapons that can do fire damage, such as the Burning Blades for your sword
users. It'll help make one of the next boss battles much easier.

If you look at your World Map, you'll see a star constantly circling Autumnia to
the northeast; this is your next destination, and you can only encounter it by
ship, so go ahead and use your 'Travel' spell to visit Hamelin. From there, head
back to the southern coast and board your ship, then sail northwest, following
along until you run into a ghost ship, the Black Porpoise. You'll be thrown into
a quick, not-too-tough boss battle, followed IMMEDIATELY by another (rather
tough) boss, so be sure to be ready!

  STATS:   1420 HP, Weak against: Storm, Resists: Physical
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯   Steal: Jumbo Stardrop

  ATTACKS: 1. Physical Attack [Single Target, Minor Damage]
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ 2. Barrel Blast [Single Target, Major Damage, Use Defend!]

Even though he's technically strong against physical attacks, you'll be able to
rack up damage quite a bit faster than waiting and casting spells. Just continue
with All-Out Attacks and do your best to cancel him so he doesn't get a hit in
edge-wise. However, if you're more comfortable with spells, or are taking too
much damage just rushing in, then switch to Esther's Drongo/Strongo (or whatever
it's morphed into) and use its Thunderspark/Thunderbolt to deal some decent
magic damage.

He does have one attack though: Barrel Blast. It's extremely easy to avoid, but
make sure you don't slip up and let it accidentally hit you; it'll take away
150+ HP.

Compared to the next boss, this guy is a pushover, so try not to waste too much
MP on him; physical attacks SHOULD be enough to deal him in.

| BOSS FIGHT: CAP'N CROSSBONES |
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  STATS:   2890 HP, Weak against: Fire & Light, Resists: Physical, Dark
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯   Steal: Night Blade

  ATTACKS: 1. Physical Attack [Single Target, Minor to Medium Damage if chained]
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ 2. Hammock Hack [Single Target, Minor Damage, Inflicts Sleep]
           3. Swashbuckler [Range, Medium Damage, Use All-Out Defense!]
           4. Plunder [Single Target, Medium Damage that restores his HP]

  REWARDS: 2380 EXP, 2530 G
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Before getting too far into the battle, try to make it quick and steal the Night
Blade.

Like the last battle, he's strong against physical attacks, but they'll still do
more damage quicker than standing by and using magic. Rush in with your familiar
while using All-Out Attack, blasting him with normal attacks before it gets too
risky with low HP; at that point, switch back to Oliver and let Esther heal you
while you fire a quick Arrow of Light or two his way. If she doesn't heal, then
take a moment to use some provisions before jumping back into the fray.

His normal attacks don't do too much damage, but sometimes, he'll get three or
four in rather quickly, hurting quite a bit before you have a chance to do
anything about it, so keep an eye on your HP. Another attack of his is Hammock
Hack; it's fairly weak, but it will inflict Sleep from time to time. Use a quick
Sleep-Be-Gone if it happens to hit. Swashbuckler, however, is decently powerful,
and will hit most (if not all of your party members) for 60+ damage, so use All-
Out Defense to minimize the damage.

He loves to use his Plunder attack, which will not only damage you fairly
decently, but it will also take that damage and turn it into restorative HP for
himself, making the battle quite a bit longer. Drippy suggests exactly what I
have above; if you see him attempt to do it again, try to attack as quickly as
you can and hope it gets cancelled. And if you're lucky, you'll knock a gold
glim out of him and get a Burning Heart attack off with Oliver.

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

After both battles, you'll receive the [SUN STONE]. Only one more stone to go!

________________________________________________________________________________


Unlike the quests for the first two stones, being able to obtain the third stone
isn't a quick and easy feat at all, and there is actually quite a bit to do
before even thinking about getting it. So to get started, use Travel to go back
to somewhere on land (The Deep Dark Wood would be best; you can stop in and use
the Waystone to recover while you're there), then summon Tengri and make your
way to the frozen continent to the northwest, the Winter Wonderlands.

You'll want to have Tengri drop you off as close to the star as possible (to the
north, just in front of the cave here.) Approach the creature at the entrance,
and he'll tell you that you can't enter without the permission from the Elder of
Yule, which is to the south. Before heading there, let's grab some treasures;
use 'Seek Fortune' if you need help.

 * You should see some twinkling stars just to the south of the Grotto, on the
   level below what you're on now. Summon Tengri, then have him drop you off on
   that level just to the southwest. Examine the forage point for a [COLDSTONE].

 • Go back up to the level you were on, then head south from the Grotto,
   following along the edge as it turns east. Once the edge merges with the rest
   of the land, go down and left a bit to get below the ledge you were just
   following, finding a [WHIRLIGIG GEM] tucked away in the corner.

 * Head directly east from the last treasure, then up a couple of hills to find
   a forage point, where you can get some [TEALWOOD].

 • Hop on Tengri, then go south-southwest; you should see two elevated snowbanks
   "pointing" west, with a gorge between them. Have Tengri put you down in that
   lower area with the gorge, then check the dead-end down there for a [DARK
   CLOUD GEM].

 • Here on this very low level, go north to find a hidden cave known as Sleety
   Hollow. Open the chest inside for a [SNOW-WHITE ICE CREAM], then go all the
   way to the dead-end. Turn around, and you should have Swaine's vantage point
   found; aim high up and to the left to find the [SNOWBLOWER GEM]. (Ignore the
   girl in here for now.)

 • Hop back on Tengri, then have him drop you off to your northwest on the level
   with the trees. Search the edge of the cliff to the southeast to find an
   [IRON DIAMOND].

 * Directly west of the last treasure is a forage point; check it for a
   [SNOWFLAKE].

 • Have Tengri drop you off on the same level as the town of Yule, then go to
   the southwesternmost corner here and search for a [JUMBO STARDROP].

 • Travel northwest along this crevasse, then keep following along the stream
   until it pours into a lake. Go as far north as you can, then circle around
   the edge of the mountains to come up to the highest level platform. Check the
   edge of it for a [BREEZE CAKE].

 • Hop back on Tengri, then have him drop you off in the open area to the west
   of Yule (across the river on the western side.) From there, go up the hill to
   the northwestern corner and enter the large wooded area to find a hidden
   forest glade. Open the two chests for a [JUMBO SUNDROP] and a [SARSAPARILLA
   SUNDAE], then stand a few steps to the northwest of the chests / west-
   southwest of the man to find the trigger point for the green chest. Open it
   for a [ROLY-POLY GEM].

 * Back on World Map, search to the south of the glade to find another forage
   point near the western edge of the area. This one has a [SNOWFLAKE].

 • To the southeast of the last forage point is another frozen lake. Have Tengri
   drop you off on the northeastern side of the lake (there's a small spot among
   the trees), then search the eastern corner for a [COLDSTONE].

 * Have Tengri drop you off just north of the beach on the southwestern side of
   the continent. Just to your north is another forage point up on a ledge; grab
   the [TEALWOOD] here.

 • Hug the wall just to the east of the last forage point, then slowly move
   south. You'll find some [CHOCOLATE BONBONS] after you come out of the trees.

There are two sets of islands just to the southwest of the main continent; Tiny
Tim to the north, and Scrooge Isle to the south.

 • On Tiny Tim isle, have Tengri drop you off on the beach, go to the
   northernmost point near the sea, then search along the edge a few steps
   southwest to find [1000 G].

 • On Scrooge Isle, have Tengri drop you off on the western part of the island,
   just beside the frozen lake. To the northwest is a forage point, so be sure
   to examine it for a [BLIZZARD BLOOM].

 • Still on Scrooge Isle, search the southernmost edge near the sea to find a
   [PIRATE'S CUTLASS].

East of Scrooge Isle / southeast of the main continent lie some more treasures.
This place is called Jack Frost's Playground!

 • On Jack Frost's Playground, have Tengri drop you off on the not-so-snowy part
   of the island to the far southeast. Search the center of this area for a
   [PURE STEEL ARMOR].

 * Along the southern edge of the island, near the center, is a forage point.
   Check it for a [FOGDROP].

 • On the western part of the island, make your way to the edge closest to the
   first piece of ice floating in the water to your northwest. Search the edge
   here for a [FROSTY FLAN].

 * The northernmost tip of the island has another forage point. This one holds a
   [BLIZZARD BLOOM].

 • The dead center of the island has a large forest, which is actually another
   hidden forest glade. Enter, then open the chests here for a [SNOW-WHITE ICE
   CREAM] and a [FROSTY FLAN]. As for the green chest, stand directly north of
   the woman here at the start of the skinny path to find the trigger point.
   From there, shoot open the chest for a [WATER SEAL].

The last island to visit is northeast of the main continent: The Sleighbell
Isles.

 * Have Tengri drop you off on the northern part of the large island, near the
   forage point. Grab the [RAW STEEL] from it.

 • Check the western side of the island, between two sets of trees, to find the
   last treasure: a [MISTY SHROUD].

Once you have all of these treasures, make your way back to the main continent
and have Tengri drop you off on the southwestern side of Yule so we can finally
pay a visit and find a way into the Grotto.

'——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————'

After arriving, make your way northeast and stop in at Swift Solutions. Talk to
the large Tomte on the right side of the room to trigger a few scenes with
Tabitha. Afterward, head back to the Cat's Cradle and choose to rest up for the
night, which will of course earn you another page for your Wizard's Companion.
This time, you get [OTHER ISLANDS].

The next morning, go to the top part of the town and enter the house on the
right, which is the elder's home. Talk to him, and he'll immediately give you
permission to enter the Grotto, and will also give you four sets of [WINTER
CLOTHES] so you can finally travel sensibly in the cold!

Before going, we have plenty to do in town. Head back inside the elder's home
and you should see Horace off to the left, as long as you've solved his riddles
in the previous towns. Talk to him with 'Spirit Medium', and he'll want to know
what the icy flowers they use in their stew are called. Feel free to flip
through your Wizard's Companion if you like (the answer is on page 139), then
when you're ready, tell him it's a "Blizzard Bloom" and he'll reward you with
the [CLOUDBURST] spell!

While you're still in the elder's house, check the urn on the right side of the
room for [WILDFLOWER SUNDAE or RUBY RIPPLE ICE CREAM or SEE-THROUGH PIE], then
head back outside. Just below the entrance on the right is a blue chest with a
[BLUNT GEM], so grab it, then head directly left of the elder's house to find a
chest with a [PHOENIX FEATHER]. Check the urn a few steps down from the chest to
find a [FROSTY FLAN], then talk to the tomte who is ice-fishing just to the
right of the chest. He will give you quite a few more recipes: 016, 021, 026,
031, 036, 041, 061, 071, 074, 080, 096, 107, and 112.

Head southwest just a bit, then turn northwest to a dead-end at an igloo. If you
stand next to the woman here and face the igloo, you should find Swaine's
vantage point to be able to collect the green chest, which is on top of the
igloo to the right. Opening it will net you a [SOULSHIELD GEM]. Go down to the
Cat's Cradle and head inside to find a chest to the left; it has a
[CHEESEBURGER] inside, while the urn beside it has a [SLEEP-BE-GONE or
NIX-BE-GONE or PHOENIX FEATHER] inside.

There's one last chest inside of Swift Solutions, but you can't get it just yet.
You'll definitely want to visit the Hootique/Peddler in Yule, as he sells some
excellent equipment and items. The Blazing Blade will prove extremely valuable
in the upcoming dungeon, and the water-resisting armor pieces are also rather
handy.

Before heading off to the Glittering Grotto, it's time to heal some hearts and
bash some baddies.

NOTE: There are four pieces of heart you can get here in Yule, and three of them
¯¯¯¯¯ will allow you to finally complete Errands that we've been waiting on.

      • Belief (Tomte beside Swift Solutions.) Use it for Errand #037 below.
      • Kindness (girl near snowman at the north end of town.) Use it for Errand
                 #019 in Ding Dong Dell.
      • Courage (kid walking around the west side of town.) Use it for Errand
                 #016 in Ding Dong Dell.
      • Confidence (grandma on the west side of the Cat's Cradle.) Use it for
                   Errand #023 in The Fairyground.

| To start this errand, you have to return to Sleety Hollow, which was the     |
| hidden cave you visited earlier to the southeast of Yule. Return there by    |
| having Tengri drop you off in the open area just to the north of the large   |
| ice chunks, then enter the cave and talk to the girl in here. Of course, to  |
| ACTUALLY speak with her, use 'Spirit Medium', and you'll find out that she   |
| just wants you to toughen her pet jabberguppy up so that it can move on      |
| without her.                                                                 |

| can either just throw it in your party and come back once the time comes, or |
| you can take it just outside of Perdida near Billy Goat's Bluff and fight    |
| four Tokotokos to get there. Either way, once you're at 40, she'll reward    |
| you and this errand will come to a close, with you keeping the pet familiar. |

| In Yule, there's a woman walking around in circles around town; talk to her  |
| to find out that she wants a swimsuit from Castaway Cove. Simple enough; use |
| 'Travel' to go there, then talk to the woman from earlier, whom you helped   |
| design a new swimsuit. (She's the one walking around in purple pants.)       |
|                                                                              |
| Of course, as chance would have it, her very last one was stolen, so you     |
| must retrieve it. Go back out on the World Map and summon Tengri, then go    |
| west to the island of Bungler's Bay. Land on the northern part of the island |
| just below some trees, then seek out the treacherous seagull to your east.   |
| Use 'Nature's Tongue' to obtain the [SNAZZY SWIMSUIT]. With it in hand,      |
| return to Yule and give it to the woman for your reward.                     |

         Cerboreas (364) (*)
________________________________________________________________________________

The first part of the Glittering Grotto is fairly straightforward, but there are
some sideways that contain treasures. These are all located on the west side of
the area, the first being in a chest to the southern dead end that contains a
[FROSTY FLAN]. Following this trail to its northwest leads to a second chest
with a [SNOW-WHITE ICE CREAM]. Return to the main path and follow it to the
north until you reach a chest with a [PHOENIX BREATH] inside. Hop on the ice
pillar to the east, using it as stepping stone to continue north. Doing so
causes it to break.

You can still backtrack by heading right/south at the intersection up ahead,
moving through the hidden tunnel next to the tomte. In any case, continue north
until you reach a chasm; cast your Pulse spell to break the stalactites loose
and use them as stepping stones. The large stalagmites blocking the western
path can be molten with a dose of Fireball.

At the intersection up ahead, turn right/east and melt away the fallen
stalactites to reach a chest with [SAGE'S SECRET] in it (the stalactites will
grow back to the ceiling). Return to the intersection and follow the path,
melting two sets of icicles (the second revealing a chest with [CHOCOLATE
BONBONS]. Following the trail leads to the lower area of the Glimmering Grotto,
but be sure to cast Pulse as you curve around the corner - there's a stalactite
on the right side of the trail as you go down - creating another stepping stone
down below.

In this lower area are several paths to take. First, move left of the platform
with the regular chest to find a green chest containing a [HOLY SHIELD]. Now
head back and take the eastern path going up the hill, moving over the stalacite
you knocked down just now. To reach the chest, simply cast Pulse again; its
contents are a [BLUSTER BLADE]. Return to the lower floor, melt the first set of
stalactites at the narrow path to the east, then run straight through the wall.
The chest in this hidden section contains a [MEDAL OF AGILITY].

Melt the other set of stalactites that's blocking the northern path to proceed
north where you'll reach an intersection. Follow the left/west path to its
northwest end to shoot a [PHOENIX TEAR] out of the green chest laying on a
platform to the far west. Don't go over the stepping stones; instead, backtrack
to the intersection and follow the eastern path.

After crossing the ice bridge, keep hugging the wall to your right/east until
you find a hidden passage giving access to a chest with a [SNOWBALL GEM] inside.
Save your game at the waystone up ahead and prepare yourself for an upcoming
boss battle; definitely equip the Blazing Blade, as well as the water-resisting
equipment you bought earlier on.

| BOSS FIGHT: CERBOREAS |
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  STATS:   6370 HP, Weak against: Fire, Resists: Water
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯   Steal: Wolf Fangs

  ATTACKS: 1. Physical Attack [Single Target, Minor to Medium Damage]
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ 2. Glacial Guard [Raises its Magical Defense]
           3. Cold Boulder [One Target, Medium Damage, Inflicts Stun,
                            Use Defend!]
           4. Howling Blizzard [All Targets, Major Damage, Use Defend &
                                All-Out Defense]

  REWARDS: 2290 EXP, 2680 G, Spirit of the Snow
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Cerboreas is a swift attacker and his physical attacks will sometimes smash you
and your familias around the area, cancelling their attacks. Since the creature
is weak against fire, casting Fireball repeatedly with Oliver in the early
stage of the fight can be beneficial; grab the golden glims with Oliver and
perform him fire-based Burning Heart. Since you can't keep abusing the boss's
weakness like that (the chance for a stun diminishes over time), focus on
timed All-Out Attacks and Defenses.

Its most dangerous attack is by far Howling Blizzard. It causes major damage to
your entire party, and it's casting time is very short, making it difficult to
defend against. Water-resistant equipment surely comes in handy here, but be
sure to heal up with a Pixie Dew afterward nonetheless.

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

After defeating Cerboreas you're finally granted the third and final magical
stone, the [STAR STONE]. You'll also unlock the [CERBOREAS] page for your
Wizard's Companion. Watch the long set of scenes that follow.

Now that you have all three stones for Mornstar, it's time to head to Hamelin to
try and figure out how to get them reunited with the wand. Feel free to take
care of the two Errands left in Yule.

NOTE: With the quest for the three stones taken care of, make sure to make a
¯¯¯¯¯ quick stop at The Deep Dark Wood. Stop by and drop Old Father Oak a line
      once again, and since you now have all three stones, he'll give you a
      bottle of [NOSTRUM].

| Talk to the little kid near the northern exit of town, and he'll tell you    |
| that the poor kid is in the Glittering Grotto, so travel there at once. Make |

| Quickly dispose of the Turban Legends first, using any fire-based tricks up  |
| your sleeve. Once they're down, then focus on the Water Ogrrr. They're not   |
| too tough, but if you don't get rid of the Turban Legends quickly, then you  |
| may have to spend extra time healing just to keep up. Once the battle is     |
| over and you've talked to the kid, you'll automatically return to Yule and   |

Hamelin
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Make your way to the palace and talk to Marcassin for a scene. He'll direct you
to someone else who may be able to help, so use the nearby magic circle to
teleport to the entrance, where you'll have another scene, but this time with a
spirit. Use 'Spirit Medium' to talk to her, and you'll learn of your next
destination. She'll also give you the [WINGS OF XANADU].

Other than that, there's only one quick item to be had here in Hamelin. Make
your way to the black market and talk to William Abel, the guy who helped you
out earlier with the armor. He's grateful that you helped restore everything to
normal, and will give you [THE TENTH TALE] of Wonder for your Wizard's
Companion!


World Map
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Summon Tengri, then make your way north of Hamelin to a new section of Autumnia
that we haven't visited yet! It's marked on your map, so just have Tengri drop
you off in front of the city.

NOTE: If you've already been to Perdida for grinding for EXP against the
¯¯¯¯¯ Tokotokos, then just use your 'Travel' spell and go straight to Perdida.
      If you're thinking about grinding for EXP against them right now, then I
      suggest you hold off for a bit longer; you'll get a spell inside the city
      that will make that much easier.

Before entering the actual city, as with the rest of the regions we've come
across so far, there are just a few treasures that we need to grab.

 * Just to the south of Perdida, you'll see a forage point. Check it for a
   [POWERSTONE].

 * Continue down the path down the mountain here, then once the path turns west,
   look for another forage point to your north. This one has [SOUR GRAPES].

 • Even further west is another treasure; when the path turns north, then west,
   check the woods to the west before it turns north again to find a [BETTLE
   HORN]. (Use the 'Seek Fortune' spell if you can't pinpoint it.)

 • Hop on Tengri, then go northwest of Perdida. You shoud see a small plateau
   with a few forests. (If you look closely at your map, you'll see that a small
   path goes east from the western beach on the island, then turns south and
   follows the spiraling path up the mountainside.) Check along the cliff behind
   the stone to the north here to find a pouch of [PHOENIX BREATH] (if you had
   not gotten it earlier on with the Sea Cow).

 * South of the stone is a forage point; check it for one of the following
   treasures: [SUN CRYSTAL or STAR CRYSTAL or MOON CRYSTAL or PLANET CRYSTAL].

Once you have all of those, hop back on Tengri or Travel back to Perdida and
head inside.

'——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————'

After the scene at the entrance, start making your rounds in the town to collect
treasures. Just to the right of the entrance to the city is an urn containing a
[FAIRY CHOCOLATE or BABANA FLAN or CARNATION CAKE], and on the opposite side
near the familiar retreat is another urn; this one has a [BREEZE CAKE]. There is
also a green chest to be had; stand in front of the peddler (who is beside the
Cat's Cradle on the right), then take a couple of steps back, while staying in
the grass. Face the east, and you should see the chest on top of the building;
use the vantage point to retrieve a [HOT-BLOODED BADGE].

Stop inside the Cat's Cradle and open the chest to the left for a [PATTY CAKE].
Talk to the purrprietor in here to rest up, making sure that your HP and MP are
maxed for the upcoming boss battle, obtaining the page for [XANADU] while you're
at it.

Back outside, go up a set of stairs to be at the center area of town. Look to
the upper right for an urn that has a [GAME PIE] inside, then go to the left.
Just to the north of the entrance of the western building is a somewhat hidden
urn, so plunder the [100 G or 150 G or 200 G] out of it, then open the chest to
the south for some [SNOWDROP BONBONS].

Stop in at Swift Solutions on the right side of town, and you'll find Horace on
the right side once again! Cast 'Spirit Medium', and he'll want to know what
character of the Nazcaän alphabet only appears in one location in your Wizard's
Companion. This one's kind of a pain, but luckily, we're here to help, so just
answer to him "Old Smoky" for the correct answer. He'll reward you with the
[VEIL] spell, which will allow you to travel past monsters unnoticed.

TIP: If you wanted to fight the Tokotokos for EXP, now it will be much easier;
¯¯¯¯ casting Veil on yourself will not alert you to their presence, and will
     allow you to sneak up on them much easier.

Two more treasures await on the north side of town, so climb the next set of
stairs, then turn left and check the corner here to find a chest containing a
[FRUIT FLAN]. From there, check the northwestern corner for a blue chest with a
[PIXIE DEW] inside.

That's it for treasures, so go back to the center area of town, then enter the
building to the west. Talk to the elderly lady, Anciana, for a scene. Save your
game, then leave the building and proceed to the top of the area for another
battle with a Nightmare.

 ________________________________
| BOSS FIGHT: KHULAN'S NIGHTMARE |
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  STATS:   5930 HP, Weak against: Light, Resists: Dark
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯
  ATTACKS: 1. Physical Attack [Single Target, Minor to Medium Damage]
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ 2. Cruel Rain [All Allies, Medium Damage, Inflicts and leaves behind
                          pools of Poison, Use Defend and All-Out Defense!]
           3. Pitch Black [All Allies, Major Damage and Inflicts Blindness, Use
                           Defend and All-Out Defense!]
  REWARDS: 2480 EXP, 2850 G, Cherub's Wing
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

As with the last one, the Nightmare is naturally weak to Light, so you can spam
Arrow of Light if you like, but as usual, I recommend a direct assault with
several All-Out Attacks with your strongest familiars. With this, you have a
good shot of cancelling attacks and knocking loose some gold glims for serious
damage.

His Cruel Rain attack is largely an annoyance; it does medium damage to your
party, and will also have a good chance of poisoning them. It also leaves behind
pools of poison on the ground, so be careful when navigating so you can avoid
them. Pitch Black is a bit stronger than Cruel Rain, and instead of poison, it
will inflict Blindness on your characters. For each attack, I recommend
Defending to minimize the damage and chances of status effects. Regardless of
which status effects do hit you, be sure to use Esther's Chant to get your party
back to normal as soon as possible.

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

After the battle, watch the scenes unfold, then take the extra bit of love that
Kublai has and give it to Queen Khulan to return her to normal. After a few more
scenes, you'll receive [THE SEVENTH TALE] of Wonder for your Wizard's Companion.
When you regain control, head back outside and talk to Khulan to the north to
begin the ritual! With it, you now have the new and improved [MORNSTAR], along
with several new spells: [HEALING HAND], [FORTUNE'S FOOL], and [UNLEASH].
Unleash is extremely useful; it allows you to summon the Guardians that you have
defeated in the past to help you in battle, dealing major damage to all enemies!
Sweet!

We're now almost ready to take on Shadar. However, we must first clear the
miasma, so to do that, we must make the Clarion. The supplies are in each of the
three major kingdoms, so our first stop will be Al Mamoon.

Before getting too pumped up to go find them, there are a couple more things to
grab here. First, know that with the new and improved Mornstar, you can now open
the purple chests that we've been teased with throughout the game! Start by
going to the elder's house (to the west, in the center part of town) and use
'Spring Lock' on the one inside to gain a bottle of [NOSTRUM].

Now that the people of the town are back to normal, they are more willing to
help you out. Just outside of the elder's house is a boy to the north; talk to
him, and he'll give you quite a few formulae: 004, 012, 048, 049, 055, 062, 066,
075, 092, 102, 117, 119, 120, and 123. After that, head to the entrance of town,
where the guard here will have one more formula for you: 126, the Herald's Harp
for Esther! You need a Cherub's Wing (just won from the boss), a Powerstone
(obtained from the forage point outside of town), and 2 Gustplumes (dropped or
stolen from the Prohawks around Perdida.) Once you have these, upgrade her
weapon!

With new story objectives unlocked comes more Errands and Bounties! And since
we can now unlock Purple Chests, we'll get those first! We'll start from Ding
Dong Dell.


   List of Purple Chests (and other treasures along the way)
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
 • Ding Dong Dell - Make your way to Swift Solutions, then proceed east and up
   a small spiral stairway that takes you up to another level. The chest is on
   the left side; open it for [SHINING SCALES].

 • Ding Dong Well - Once you've made it to the well, use your 'Chart Chests'
   spell to see that it's at the end of the dungeon, just to the west of the
   Waystone in the section beside it, at a dead-end. Just follow the path from
   the start all the way to the end, but once you head north past the last lit
   torch, continue all the way north, then east to the dead-end. Inside will be
   [BLACKWYRM CLAWS].

 • Golden Grove - From the southern entrance/exit, just head west of the
   Waystone here to find the chest. This one has a [HOCUS FOCUS GEM].

 • Old Smoky - Thankfully we don't have to go far for this one. From the
   entrance, just go north to the first fork, then head all the way southeast
   and you'll find it at the dead-end. It has a [SPIRE OF FIRE GEM] inside.

 • Hamelin - Go to the Black Market, and there is a purple chest waiting near
   the shopkeeper. It has a [TRICKSY NIXY GEM].

 • The Tombstone Trail - If you use 'Chart Chests', you'll see that this purple
   chest is at the westernmost point of the map, between the first and second
   Waystones of the area. So just head east, then north, then west, and it
   should be on your left as you turn north again, at the base of a tree. This
   one contains a [DARK CLOUD GEM].

 • The Vault of Tears - This one is at the far northeastern corner of the
   dungeon, so use 'Chart Chests' to pinpoint it. It's along the easternmost
   wall in the lower portion of the room, to the south, and has a [STEAM HAMMER]
   inside, an excellent weapon for your more burly familiars.

 • The Glittering Grotto - Make your way all the way north until you can descend
   to the lower level of the area - using Pulse along the way to make bridges -
   then use 'Chart Chests'. You'll see that it is directly north, in the section
   to the left of the next Waystone. Take the western north path here and follow
   it to the open area here to be able to get the [HELM OF HAMELIN].

NOTE: After finding all of these chests above, ALL of the places listed under
¯¯¯¯¯ 'Dangerous Places' by the Telling Stone should be marked as 'Percentage
      Explored: 100%', and 'Cleared!'

   Now, for all of the purple chests in places that we can't just 'Travel' to.


 • Russet Isle - Travel to Skull Mountain, the fly south-southwest of it back to
   Russet Isle. Enter the forest glade here in the center of the island, then
   open the purple chest here for a [BEAST-HIDE CLOAK].

 • Shipwreck Shore - Travel to The Vault of Tears, then fly to forest glade
   directly east-southeast, which is on a higher plateau to the east, near the
   wrecked ship by the shore. The chest here has a [NIGHT BLADE].

 • Alchemist's Cave - Travel to Castaway Cove, then fly just to the north, and
   look for the Cave once again on the eastern plateau as you go to fly into the
   Shimmering Sands. Open this chest for a [STARSPUN TUNIC].

 • No Longer Mine Isle - Travel to The Fairyground, then fly north to No Longer
   Mine Isle. Enter the forest glade here at the southern tip of the island (the
   tiny isle covered in nothing but trees) and open the chest here for a [MEDAL
   OF VALOR].

 • Hermit's Shell - As with before, you can only reach it by boat, so travel to
   Castaway Cove and head west in the Sea Cow. Once you're on Hermit's Shell,
   enter the Hermitage here and open the purple chest near the Puss in Boats for
   a set of [SORCERESS'S ROBES].

   Now, for a mix of exploration while finishing up the purple chests.


   Bungler's Bay:
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
   This island is directly south of Old Smoky, or west of Castaway Cove, if you
   look at it that way.

 • Have Tengri drop you off on the northern part of the island, just south of
   the trees. Check the forest all the way to the north to find a [DROWSY DROPS
   GEM].

 * Head west along the mountain while saying on the high level, and you'll come
   across a forage point with [GREEN GRAPES].

 • Hop back on Tengri and have him drop you off on the tree-covered island to
   the northeast just off the coast. There's a forest glade here, so head
   inside. Open the purple chest for a [BRINKMAN'S BADGE]. There's also a green
   chest way up to the east. Use your 'Chart Chests' spell, then stand directly
   west from the chest icon as far as you can, and face east to find the vantage
   point. Have Swaine crack it open for you to obtain the [DRAGONSTOOTH RING].


   Turtle Crag isle:
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
   This island is west of Russet Isle, or south of Yule. Travel to Yule, then
   head to the far south to Turtle Crag isle, the smaller island northwest of
   the lower left continent.

 * Land in the center of the island, then check the forage point to the north
   for a [RUMBLENUT].

 • From the center, travel to the northernmost forest to enter a forest glade.
   Open the purple chest on the right side for a suit of [ENIGMA ARMOR], then
   stand about halfway between the purple chest and the northern exit. Face the
   southwest from here, and you should see a green chest and Swaine's vantage
   point; open the green chest for a [SLOW POKE GEM].

 • Make your way to the southeastern beach of the island, then follow along the
   eastern edge of it as you travel north to come to a dead end. There's a chest
   here with a [PIXIE DEW].

With all of that exploration done, it's time to take care of the errands and
bounties.

| In Perdida, to your northeast as soon as you enter, is Derwin, and he has a  |
| a new, excruciatingly painful task for you. He needs a Wispula, a Flash Fry, |
| and a Trumpy-Pumper. However, you can't catch these; they need to be         |
| metamorphosed from their weaker forms. (In the listing below, the left one   |
| is the one he needs, and their evolution steps are to the right:)            |
|                                                                              |
| • Wispula <-- Ghost Wisperer (Nevermore) <-- Wisp (Tombstone Trail)          |
| • Flash Fry <-- Deep Fry (Old Smoky) <-- Small Fry (Old Smoky)               |
| • Trumpy-Pumper <-- Sharper-Parper (Miasma Marshes) <-- Shonky Honker (Cove) |
|                                                                              |
| TIP: The Ghost Wisperer can be tamed in Nevermore later on in the game, if   |
| ¯¯¯¯ you want to wait and save on evolving the Wisp twice. Same goes for the |
|      Sharper-Parper in the Miasma Marshes. If you're grinding Tokotokos      |
|      though, you might as well just get the earlier versions; one fight may  |
|      be enough to evolve them.                                               |
|                                                                              |
| Catch the monsters listed above, then metamorphose them into their stronger  |
| versions to be able to complete this errand. You'll most likely be doing a   |
| LOT of grinding of Tokotokos to get this one done quickly.                   |

| Once you're going head to head with the Ice Ogrrr, you'll want to control    |
| Oliver and spam his fire-based Unleash spell, Volcanic Roar. If that's too   |
| much of a slow pace for you, then use a familiar that has the Blazing Blade  |

| is more dangerous than it looks; it will hit your whole party for medium to  |

| coming, and be sure to use Pixie Dews and other healing items/spells right   |

After you're finished with all of these errands and hunts, it's time to get a
start on making that Clarion!


PROCURING THE CLARION [WLK-6.3]
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
ITEMS: [ ] Holy Wood, [ ] Carved Holy Wood, [ ] The Clarion, [ ] Gustplume
¯¯¯¯¯¯
PAGES: [ ] 294-298 (The Ninth Tale)
¯¯¯¯¯¯
ENEMIES: Philip's Nightmare (367) (*)
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
________________________________________________________________________________

The first place we need to go to get materials for the Clarion is Al Mamoon, so
go ahead and Travel there.


To Al Mamoon
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Make your way to the palace and talk to the Cowlipha. Without a fuss, you'll
receive the [HOLY WOOD]! Next stop: Ding Dong Dell!


To Ding Dong Dell
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Start making your way to see King Tom, only to have your Holy Wood disappear
once you get to the entrance of the palace. Head back to the first area of town
and pay a visit to the Cawtermaster; he actually just bought it from a young
mouse that pawned it to him, and he won't give it back until you give him proof.

Head outside, then make your way toward Swift Solutions. Just to the east is a
small spiral stairway that takes you up to another level, so head up there to
find the tiny rodent on the railing. Talk to him, and after receiving a few
insults, Oliver realizes that he reminds him of Phil, and that we need to go
check on him to make sure everything is okay.

Before doing anything else, make sure to stop at the Cat's Cradle and rest up so
that your HP and MP is maxed. When you're ready, cast 'Gateway' to return to
Motorville.


To Motorville
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Save your game, then head over to Oliver's house, where Phil will be waiting for
you. He's not waiting to show you something awesome this time...

| BOSS FIGHT: PHILIP'S NIGHTMARE |
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  STATS:   4560 HP, Weak against: Light, Resists: Dark
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯
  ATTACKS: 1. Physical Attack [Single Target, Minor to Medium Damage]
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ 2. Ill Will [Self, boosts attack and magic attack]
           3. Rain of Terror [All Allies, Major Damage and Inflicts Random
                              Status Effects, try to cancel!]
  REWARDS: 2630 EXP, 2980 G
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

As with the last one, the Nightmare is naturally weak to Light, so you can spam
Arrow of Light if you like, but as usual, I recommend a direct assault with
several All-Out Attacks with your strongest familiars. With this, you have a
good shot of cancelling attacks and knocking loose some gold glims for serious
damage.

There's not much to worry about when it comes to his Ill Will; it just boosts
his attack, and there's not much to do about it. Rain of Terror, however, will
royally screw up your whole party VERY quickly, so don't even try to defend
against it; go for All-Out Attacks and keep him from even using it. If you do
get hit with it, then switch to Esther and have her work on removing the status
with Chant.

If you find yourself having a hard time dealing with the Nightmare, feel free to
try out your new spell, Unleash! Summoning the Gladiataur and using Everblade
will easily dish out 200+ damage with each casting.

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

After the battle, you need to use Take Heart on yourself to get some ambition
to help bring Phil back out of his funk. Watch the scenes here, then use
'Gateway' once again to return to Ding Dong Dell.


Back to Ding Dong Dell
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Head back to the upper level where you first found Pip, and talk to him again;
now that Phil is back to normal, Pip apologizes and agrees to help sort things
out. Once that's over, you'll have the Holy Wood back in hand, so make your way
to the palace to see King Tom. As with Her Moojesty, His Meowjesty will gladly
fork over what's needed for the Clarion, and in his case, it's to quickly carve
the wood for you, turning it into (as expected) [CARVED HOLY WOOD]!

There are a few more Errands now available that you can complete before moving
on.


To Hamelin
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Make your way to the palace to talk to Marcassin. Show him the carved wood, and
he and Swaine will give it the finishing touches, allowing you to finally have
[THE CLARION]! You will also receive a new page for your Wizard's Companion,
[THE NINTH TALE] of Wonder!

Before heading off, use the magic circle to be just outside of the palace, then
talk to the ghostly guard, Abyssinia, again using 'Spirit Medium' to fill her in
on what happened. She'll thank you by giving you a [GUSTPLUME].

Now that ambition is available, there are a few more Errands now available that
you can complete before moving on.

TIP: You should have amassed quite a few Stamp Cards by now that you can turn in
¯¯¯¯ for rewards! I suggest using them for the ultimate reward first, the 'Jack

     BOTH his HP and MP!

Once those are all done, you'll be just about ready to make your way to the
Miasma Marshes. But first, you will need to stop by The Deep Dark Wood.


To The Deep Dark Wood
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Drop by and speak to Old Father Oak to tell him of your adventure. Like once
before, you won't obtain any treasure, but you'll have some new dialogue to see!
(Before, we gave you the dialogue to save on time, but since it's so simple to
make the trip, we recommend you go ahead and see it for yourself! Just use
'Travel' and make it quick!)

Once you're done and ready to proceed, use 'Travel' to visit Perdida once more.


Perdida
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Proceed all the way north past Khulan and out the northern side of the city to
be in a dark valley near the miasma.

ITEMS: [ ] Espresso, [ ] Dead Man's Duds, [ ] All-Be-Gone, [ ] Fruit Flan,

         Bougie-Woogie (275), Whampire Bat (087), Vileheart (368) (*),
         Vileheart (369) (*)
________________________________________________________________________________

TIP: On the map to the Marshes is an enemy that only appears here; the Firefry.
¯¯¯¯ If you plan on taming one (or want to farm them for their Hocus Focus Gems)
     then do it now.

There are a couple of enemies outside on the World Map. Other than that, there's
nothing to worry about, so go on and enter the deadly marshes. Once you're
inside, Esther will clear them out for you with the Clarion. After a scene, you
will be able to explore the Quagmire of Corruption! (Giggity!)

Before moving, you'll want to cast 'Levitate', and keep it on the entire time.
The whole area is covered with random poison traps, so use the spell and keep an
eye on the icon in the upper left corner; if you see it start to blink, cast it
again, and be careful NOT to touch the ground.

Use the Waystone if you need to, then proceed northwest to a fork. Open the
chest to your left first to find an [ESPRESSO], then return to the fork and make
your way to the far northwestern dead-end for a blue chest containing a set of
[DEAD MAN'S DUDS]. Head back to the Waystone to heal, then proceed northeast,
going all the way up when you can to find another chest at a dead-end. Open it
for an [ALL-BE-GONE].

Head down from that chest now, and you'll soon come to an open area / awkward
fork in the path. Take a few steps north, then turn east to find a red chest
near the water with a [FRUIT FLAN] inside. Turnleft, then you'll be at another
split as you go up. Continue up, then go right and down to find a blue chest at
a dead-end; unlock it for a [FIEND'S FANG].

Go back to the fork and continue west, then a tiny bit north to be at another
somewhat open fork. Head up and to the right first, grabbing the [TONIC] at the
dead-end here, then return and go slightly left, then down. You'll come to
another dead-end down here to the left, along with a nice purple chest. Unlock
it for a suit of [NIGHT ARMOR]. Return to the fork, then go northwest, moving
up as you go, but stopping before you turn right. There's a green chest to your
west, so go up against the upper left edge here to find Swaine's vantage point,
allowing you to snipe a bottle of [SPRITE DEW].

That's it for treasure, so head right and follow the path to another Waystone.
Use it, then proceed northwest to take on the evil Vileheart.

| BOSS FIGHT: VILEHEART |
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  STATS:   6830 HP, Weak against: Light, Resists: Dark
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯   Steal: Barrier Badge

  ATTACKS: 1. Physical Attack [Range attack, Minor Damage]
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ 2. Vile Breath [All Allies, Inflicts Poison]
           3. Viledriver [Range attack, Major Damage, Inflicts Stun, Use Defend
                          and All-Out Defense!]
  REWARDS: 2840 EXP, 3140 G
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Right off the bat, switch to Swaine and be sure to steal that Barrier Badge! It
gives an enormous boost to defense and magic defense when equipped!

As for the battle itself, Vileheart is going to be constantly using attacks that
inflict Poison, so don't even bother with trying to remove the status; just keep
your party healed the best you can using all-healing tricks and items like Pixie
or Sprite Dew.

Start off with your strongest physically attacking familiars, using All-Out
Attack during the majority of the battle to inflict as much damage as possible.
The only two exceptions will be to heal with Oliver as necessary, and to defend
against the Viledriver. When you see the Viledriver coming, QUICKLY switch to
All-Out Defense and choose to Defend; you'll not only minimize damage, but you
will be able to knock him off guard and possibly grab some gold glims after
assaulting him, giving you a chance to really pile on the hurt.

The battle may seem to drag on for a while thanks to the poison, but as long as
you try to keep everyone about 50% of their HP (and keep Esther's MP replenished
for healing), you should be okay.

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

After the battle, watch the quick scene before you regain control in a different
area. Just go forward to progress the story, the watch the story unfold in a
major way.

You'll eventually regain control of Esther in Perdida. Head south to the exit
for another long set of scenes between Esther and Swaine, then with Oliver. It
will all lead to another battle with Vileheart, but this time, with the ultimate
[MORNSTAR] spell in his posession!

           3. Viledriver [Range attack, Major Damage, Inflicts Stun, Use Defend
                          and All-Out Defense!]
  REWARDS: 2930 EXP, 3230 G
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

The only noticeable difference in this battle, other than it being much easier
with the Mornstar spell, having fewer HP to whittle away, and having to fight
with cheesy inspirational music over the awesome normal boss theme, is that
Swaine can steal a Jumbo Sundrop, so be sure to grab it.

Other than that, the fight is mostly the same. He'll attack the same way, so
still defend against the Viledriver. But he does have a different trick instead
of Vile Breath, and it's Vile Roar. It'll attack everyone while inflicting
Curse, so defend against it like you would for the Viledriver to minimize
damage.

For your attacks, just control Oliver and stay as far away from Vilehart as you
can, continuously casting Mornstar until it wipes him completely out! It should
only take a handful of turns!

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

After the battle, make any preparations needed before heading to Nevermore. When
you're ready, use 'Travel' to go back to the Miasma Marshes, then proceed to the
magic circle in front of you. It'll take you back to where you fought Vileheart,
so from there, just travel northwest and follow the path to enter Nevermore!

________________________________________________________________________________

If you haven't been leveling up all that much lately, it's a good idea to build
some levels by hanging out at the valley of Perdida, slaughtering Tokotoko's
with the help of the Veil spell (gotten from Horace in Perdida). Remember that
these green little staff-wielding creatures give 8000 experience a piece, which
should allow you to hit the mid 50s easily. Try to be around level 50 and view
that as baseline minimum to get through Nevermore Castle without a ridiculous
amount of struggle. If you can spare the 30 to 45 minutes leveling up, late 50s
will make things considerably easier - it's up to you.

Travel to the entrance of The Miasma Marshes and use the teleport circle to
warp to its northern end, granting immediate access to Nevermore Castle up
ahead. Save your game at the waystone and enter through the creepy gate...

1st Floor
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
The castle's first floor is a straightforward hall. At the first intersection
move east to find a blue chest with a [SAGE'S SECRET] inside. The west path
leads to a Crystal Ball that makes a set of stairs appear to the north, granting
passage. At the next intersection, loot the chest to the west for a [PHOENIX
BREATH] and unlock a second set of stairs by activating the Crystal Ball to the
east. As you go through the doors, don't miss the chest immediately to your
left; it contains a [SPRITE DEW].

2nd Floor
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
As you go upstairs the camera turns upside down, possibly confusing you to the
bone. Head up the left/north flight of stairs and follow it to the end; either
keep looking at the mini map and steer Oliver by solely looking at it, or turn
your head for a little while and get a nice rush of blood to the head. At the
end of the hall you can find an amazing [DRAGON LANCE], which you should equip
to one of your familiars immediately. Return to the intersection take the right
(south) flight of stairs.

Of course, the camera still turns to strange angles here; closely follow our
directions on your minimap. You'll get at a three-way intersection. First head
left/south to find a [SHIELD OF THE PURE] inside a chest (on the left side of
the next intersection, the other side leads to a dead end). Back at the three-
way intersection, head straight/west to find a chest with some [GRIFFIN'S
TEETH]. Finally, head right/north to reach another intersection and a set of
doors.

The chest to the left contains a [NOSTRUM] and to the right is a vantage point
for Swaine to open a green chest containing the fantastic [BOARLOARD'S ARMOR].
Just stand near the balcony's edge to locate it down below.

Head through the doors to reach a circular chamber. Move to the south edge of
this room and step a little to the west, at seven 'o clock; stand near the edge
toward the middle to find a vantage point for Swaine. The green chest on top of
one of the pillars contains the fine [GIANT'S AX].

Move through the doors to the south and enter through the next set of doors to
your left/east, locating a blue chest with an [ALL-BE-GONE] inside. The second
doors only lead to a dead end, but the third reveal a Crystal Ball that allows
you to continue further west. Be sure to open the purple chest to the south
before going upstairs; it contains a fine [RADIANT BLADE], which drains 10% of
the damage inflicted to enemies, healing you with it. Upstairs you'll find a
chest with a [GREAT SAGE'S SECRET] inside to the left of the doors. Go through
the doors and activate the final Crystal Ball, revealing a large set of stairs
in the circular chamber, leading the the third and final floor of Nevermore.

Shadar The Dark Djinnn
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
It's time to finally face Shadar, but be sure to save your game at the waystone
first and prepare yourself for a series of rather tough fights - what'd you
expect? It *is* the Dark Djinnn, the Executor himself, after all.

 ____________________
| BOSS FIGHT: SHADAR |
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  STATS:   3900 HP, Weak against: Light, Resists: Dark
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯   Steal: Wizard's Robes

  ATTACKS: 1. Pyre [Single Target, Fire Element, Minor to Medium Damage]
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ 2. Fell Wind [Ranged, Storm Element, Medium Damage]
           3. Bleak Midwinter [All Targets, Water Element, Major Damage]
           4. Evenstar [All Targets, Dark Element, Major Damage, Use Defend &
                        All-Out Defense!]

Shadar has powerful tricks up his sleeves, although some are definitely more
powerful than others. Pyre only hits a single target, so if you see Shadar
preparing this have the targetted character defend (or prepare to heal them).
Fell Wind is a ranged attack, so staying away from Shadar helps avoiding it.
Bleak Midwinter, on the other hand, is a very powerful attack that hits everyone
no matter where they're standing, so *always* order an All-Out Defense and
Defend with your current character when you see Shadar preparing it.

His Evenstar attack is his most powerful trick. Although defending against it
works okay, a much better strategy is to cancel the attack altogether. You'll
have to do this with your Mornstat spell. The only problem is that Mornstar
takes a while to cast, at which point Shadar will already have unleashed his
deadly Evenstar. Fortunately, Shadar only casts Evenstar after warping close to
his throne and using Fell Wind. Avoid the latter by moving away from him and
immediately start casting Oliver's Mornstar spells (before Shadar starts
preparing his Evenstar). If done correctly, Oliver blasts Shadar with Mornstar
when he's only beginning to prepare his powerful move, cancelling the spell and
leaving him vulnerable to a flurry of attacks, possibly even generating golden
glims.

Do keep your party healthy at all times, and make sure your party is healthy
both in terms of HP and MP when Shadar's health bar is nearly depleted. After
all, you've got two more battles coming up!

| BOSS FIGHT: ETERNAL KNIGHT |

  STATS:   6370 HP, Weak against: Light, Resists: Dark
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯   Steal: Night Armor

  ATTACKS: 1. Physical Attack [Ranged, Medium Damage]
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ 2. Dark Aegis [Boosts Defense]
           3. Onslaught [All Targets, Major Damage, Use Defend &
                         All-Out Defense!]

The Eternal Knight is basically a grunt that relies on physical attacks to do
his talking. Get too close and his double-hitting physical attack will quickly
sap the life out of you. Preferably keep your distance while using spells and
provisions to attack Eternal Knight and respectively keep your party healthy.

The Knight will usually follow one of your characters around the area. You can
keep him distracted by having that familiar or character defend, heal, or
attack while the others use spells from afar.

There's one attack you definitely want to defend against, which is Onslaught.
Immediately order an All-Out Defense and Defend with your current character,
since it could potentially wipe out an unprepared party. When the end of the
battle draws near, heal your party with a Sprite Dew (or something similar),
and be sure that your characters have some MP left for the third battle.

  STATS:   8830 HP, Weak against: Light, Resists: Dark
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯   Steal: Jumbo Stardrop

  ATTACKS: 1. Blast from Beyond [Straight Line Attack, Medium Damage]
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ 2. Pitch Black [Straight Line Attack, Medium Damage]
           3. Circles of Hell [Ranged; Forms Damaging Circles, Medium Damage]
           4. Fell Sweep [Ranged, Medium to Major Damage]
           5. World's End [All Targets, Heavy Damage]

  REWARDS: 6720 EXP, 7400 G
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Shadar's transformed form is powerful, but with the right tactics he's
definitely beatable. His Blast from Beyond attack is a 'beam' type attack that
only hits targets on the left side of the screen. Conversely, the Pitch Black
attack only hits people on the right side of the screen. Staying mostly in the
middle zone of the area should render those two attacks harmless.

The Circles of Hell attack deals quite some damage, but the circles are formed
before they start hurting anyone inside them, so stepping outside of any will
prevent you from incurring damage. This won't always work for the characters
controlled by the AI, so healing may sometimes be necessary.

The Fell Sweep is his ranged physical attack, which you can either avoid by
standing far away from Shadar, or defend against (including an All-Out Defense
if possible).

His most devastating attack - by far - is the World's End move. IMMEDIATELY
order an All-Out Defense and Defend with your currect character, since it is
potentially powerful enough to wipe you out. Fortunately for you, Shadar won't
use it too often, and successfully defending against it leaves the Djinn
defenseless, allowing you to order an All-Out Attack for a short while, boosting
your chances for getting golden glims.

Remember that this is a tough series of fights, and there's no shame in using
good healing items every once in a while, such as a Phoenix Down (or even Tear)
when an ally has fallen, or Sprite Dew to give your entire party a great health
boost, not to mention the delicious espresso's - not that you'd fall asleep
during this battle, but the MP boost will come in handy.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

After the battles, a *lot* of scenes will play, and you'll receive [EVENSTAR],
Shadar's powerful spell, as well as [ALICIA'S PENDANT]. When you finally get
to control Oliver once again, head to King Tom and speak with him twice to
trigger more cutscenes.

RESTORING THE KINGDOMS [WLK-7.1]
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
ITEMS: [ ] Flower of Youth, [ ]

PAGES: [ ] The Young Woman's Journal, [ ] Thunderstorm

________________________________________________________________________________


You'll eventually find yourself aboard the Iron Wyvern airship, stuck forever...
Actually, you're simply supposed to cast the Gateway spell now to meet Pea in
Motorville.

Do so and head to Oliver's house to the south. Go inside his room to find Pea;
afterward, head inside his mother's room and check the drawers in the lower
corner of the screen to find a new page for your Wizard's Companion [THE YOUNG
WOMAN'S JOURNAL]. When you've done that, cast Gateway to head back to Another
World. 

You'll return to Ding Dong Dell after various scenes, and you'll have to detroy
the crystal producing the foul manna, so head directly for the King's Castle
(there are no new treasures to be found). Unfortunately, the Veil spell doesn't
currently work, so you'll have to avoid enemies manually should you desire it.
Be sure to save your game at the waystone right before entering the castle,
because a boss fight is coming up.

| BOSS FIGHT: KING TOM XIV |
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  STATS:   4800 HP, Weak against: ---, Resists: ---
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯   Steal: Cat King's Claws

  ATTACKS: 1. Physical Attack [One Target, Minor to Medium Damage]
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ 2. Royal Roar [Beam Attack, Medium Damage]
           3. Crazy Claws [All Targets, Major Damage, Use Defend &
                           All-Out Defense!]
           4. Cat Slap [One Target, Major Damage]
           5. Itchy Scratchy [All Targets, Major Damage, Inflicts Poison,
                              Use Defens & All-Out Defense!]

  REWARDS: 3900 EXP, 4200 G
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

It's important to know that once you've depleted the kind's health bar, it will
refill again completely, leading the battle into a second, much more difficult
stage. Definitely play defensively whenever you see Crazy Claws being prepared.
Royal Roar is also powerful, but can at least be avoided.

During the second stage, Tom will use Cat Slap instead of Royal Roar. It's a
very powerful attack against a single target, so you'll want to defend and/or
heal that target. The Itchy Scratchy attack is definitely worth defending
against, since it deals major damage and also inflicts your characters with
poison. Keep your health up with powerful healing spells and items and don't be
afraid to use Phoenix Feathers when required.


¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

After the battle a batch of scenes plays and Ding Dong Dell will be pure again.
You'll also receive the [FLOWER OF YOUTH].

TIP: You can go visit Horace at the monument to the northeast of the town square
¯¯¯¯ and solve another riddle; this time the answer is: Unleash. You'll be
     given the [THUNDERSTORM] spell.

Now travel to Al Mamoon and make your way to the castle, only to find out that
her Moojesty has also been converted into a horrible creature (to think that it
was possible, but alas... yes.)

| BOSS FIGHT: QUEEN LOWLA |
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  STATS:   5100 HP, Weak against: ---, Resists: ---
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯   Steal: Patty Cake

  ATTACKS: 1. Physical Attack [One Target, Minor to Medium Damage]
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ 2. Haught Snort [Beam-type, Medium Damage]
           3. Royal Rush [One Target, Major Damage, Use Defend &
                          All-Out Defense!]
           4. Haughty Huff [Beam-type, Medium Damage]
           5. Flying Cow [All Targets, Inflicts Stun, Major Damage,
                          Use Defend & All-Out Defense!]

  REWARDS: 4100 EXP, 4200 G
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Again, it's important to know that Queen Lowlah too will heal her health bar in
it entirety after depleting it once, as the second stage of the battle starts.
The first stage shouldn't be too difficult; you'll want to move to the queen's
back and attack her (from) behind. This should allow you to avoid most of her
physical attacks, as well as her beam-type Haughty Snort. Her Royal Rush targets
a single target; defend from it if she's targeting the character you're
currently controlling, otherwise go for an All-Out Defense.

The second phase is somewhat more difficult than the first. Her Haughty Snort
has been replaced by Haughty Huff, but that's just as easily avoided. More
dangerous is her Flying Cow attack, which aims for the entire party; always
defend whenever you see the queen preparing something.

Drippy will tell you that it's possible to weigh the queen down with Burden.
This is a good idea; successfully doing so will stun her and generate golden
glims if you go in with an All-Out Attack. If you keep your party healthy and
stick with the strategy from the first half, victory will be yours.

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

After the battle, various scenes play. You'll also receive the [FLOWER OF
FAITH]. It's now time to restore the third kingdom, Hamelin, so travel there
and start making your way to the far north of town. Heal up at the waystone and
prepare yourself for another tough boss battle.

NOTE: This is your last chance to battle wretches. If you're aiming for a
¯¯¯¯¯ complete file, be sure to battle all (ten) varieties now before moving on.

Before you move to the palace's main hall, you'll want to equip your fighters
with storm-based weapons, even if they're slightly worse in terms of attack
power than your best pieces of weaponry. Continue to the main hall to face
Hamelin's most deadly machine, Porco Loco.

 ________________________
| BOSS FIGHT: PORCO LOCO |
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  STATS:   2880 HP, Weak against: Storm, Resists: Physical
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯   Steal: Jumbo Planetdrop

  ATTACKS: 1. Physical Attack [Medium Damage]
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ 2. Pigswill [Single Target, Minor to Medium Damage, Use Defend!]
           3. Pigshot [Single Target, Minor to Medium Damage, Use Defend!]
           4. Pork Scrappings [All Targets, Medium to Major Damage,
                               Use Defend & All-Out Defense!]

  REWARDS: 4200 EXP, 4200 G
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
The fight against Porco Loco - again - consists of two phases, the first being
considerably easier than the second. Its physical attacks aren't too powerful,
and its Pigswill trick (and Pigshot in the second phase) only targets a single
ally.

Much more dangerous is its Pork Scrappings attack, only used in the second phase
of the fight, which targets all allies and deals quite a lot of damage. When you
see it coming, order an All-Out Defense and Defend with the character you're
currently controlling. Cancelling its weaker Pigswill/shot can net you quite
a few glims, and abusing its storm weakness with a spell such as Thunderspark
(which a familiar such as Drongo has access to) might stun the boss, giving
you plenty of time for a flurry of attacks, cutting golden glims loose in the
process.

Stay healthy in the second phase of the fight, and keep fighting offensively
unless the boss prepares Pork Scrappings; timely switch to an All-Out Defense 
and you should make it out of the fight alive.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
You'll receive various alchemy formulae after the fight, as well as the [FLOWER
OF HOPE]. After the scenes you can finally make your way to the hidden continent
on the southwest of the world map.


THE IVORY TOWER [WLK-7.2]
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
ITEMS: [ ] Griffin's Talons, [ ] Celestial Armor, [ ] Great Sage's Secret,
¯¯¯¯¯¯ [ ] Sprite Dew, [ ] Phoenix Tear, [ ] Glorious Lance, [ ] Astra,
       [ ] Nostrum, [ ] Wyrmfang Ring, [ ] Tonic, [ ] Wizard King's Secret

________________________________________________________________________________

Talk to Pea when you're ready to depart with Tengri. The Ivory Tower is located
on The Spring Realm, on the southwest of the world map. Tengri can only land at
the drawing of a bird in the southeast corner of the island, so you'll have to
circle all the way around this isle to reach the actual tower. Right before
entering you'll notice a faded picture of another bird; use Rejuvenate to
restore it, creating a second landing platform for Tengri. After creating a
Bridge, enter Ara Memoriae.

Put the three flowers iside the pots and inspect the altar in the middle.
Naturally, cutscenes will play. Speak with Kublai afterward and rest up.
After this, speak with Marcassin (twice) to begin an assault on the Ivory Tower.
Oliver and crew will enter the tower with Tengri, whom you can always speak to
if you want to leave the place.

There are a lot of great items to be found here, so it's well worth exploring
the entire area, opening all chests. We'll start exploring the west section
first. From the waypoint at the end of the main hall, head west. At the north
end of the first hall way is a purple chest that contains [GRIFFIN'S TALONS], 
which are great claws. Continue to the far southwest of the hallways to find a
chest containing [CELESTIAL ARMOR], which is a great piece of equipment. The
dead ends to the north and south don't house any chests, but there's a
teleporter to the northwest that gives access to a balcony containing a chest
with a [GREAT SAGE'S SECRET] inside. Return to the waystone in the main hall
(as you've fully explored the western section of this floor).

From the main hall, head east, and at the intersection continue to the 
teleported in the far northeast of the area (the southeast teleporter leads to
a vacant balcony, and there are no other items in that area either). 

NOTE: From now on, some Magimechs will activate and attack you. They're rather
¯¯¯¯¯ strong, so if you want to avoid them it's best to cast the Veil spell
      when entering hallways with Magimechs.

After using the northeast teleporter, head to the far south of this hall to find
a regular chest with [SPRITE DEW] inside. Continue west and explore the far
north of the walkway to find a chest with a [PHOENIX TEAR]. Be sure to shimmy
over the ledge to the left/west side of the northwest walkway; at the end is a
small platform, and if you turn around you can spot a green chest that contains
a GLORIOUS LANCE]. Return to the walkway and shimmy over the ledge to the
southwest, leading to a waystone. Be sure to save your game before you proceed.

| BOSS FIGHT: GALLUS |

  STATS:   9700 HP, Weak against: Varies, Resists: Varies
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯   Steal: Jumbo Moondrop

  ATTACKS: 1. Physical Attack 
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ 2. Terra Infirma [Single Target, Physical, Medium Damage]
           3. Fire Trident [Ranged, Fire Element, Try to avoid]
           4. Bolt of Judgment [Ranged, Forms damaging areas, Storm Element,
                                Try to avoid]
           5. Absolute Zero [All Targets, Water Element, Use Defend &
                             All-Out Defense!]

  REWARDS: 4850 EXP, 4600 G
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
The fight with Gallas shouldn't be too hard if you know what you're doing.
Gallus will change the color of his aura after a short while, and depending on
the color he'll also change his primary attack spell. If his aura turns red,
he'll use Fire Trident and becomes resistant against fire but weak versus water.
If his aura turns green he will become resistant against storm but weak to fire,
and he will use the Bolt of Judgment attack.

Lastly, if his aura turns blue, he'll be resisting water-based attack but become
weak against storm tricks. He'll also use his more powerful attack by far,
Absolute Zero (naturally aptly named). When Gallus changes his aura to blue,
immediately order an All-Out Defense until he changes to a different color
again, and be sure to defend against it with your currently controlled character
to minimize damage. Make sure your familiar has access to the Defend option
during this time. When he changes aura again, immediately switch to an All-Out
Attack in the hope of cancelling one of his (weaker) attacks.

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
After the battle you're receive [ASTRA], an immensely powerful wand, stronger
even than the Mornstar.

TIP: If you've solved all of Horace's riddles so far, now is a great time to
¯¯¯¯ backtrack to Ara Memoriae, where you'll find... Horace. Solve his riddle
     (the answer can be found on page 117 of the Wizard's Companion, and is of
     course 'Wizard's Robes') and he'll give you the incredibly strong [ASTRA
     SPELL], which will surely help in the final battle.

In any case, save your game at the last waypoint and use the teleporter to the
north to reach the tower's next floor. First explore the eastern section;
follow the first walkway to its southern end to find a [NOSTRUM]. There's a blue
chest in the far northeast of the area that contains a [WYRMFANG RING].

Head to the western section of this floor and continue to the second walkway
towards the west. Explore the southern dead end of this walkway to find a
[TONIC], then head for the western hall and use the teleport at the southern
end.

Continue east and loot the chest to the far south of the walkway for a
[SORCERER'S SOUL]. Don't miss the ledge to the northeast, which leads to a
chest with the ultra-rare [WIZARD KING'S SECRET]!

TIP: If you see a Tokotocold around this area, immediately cast Veil and attack
¯¯¯¯ them. They're rather rare, but give a whopping 24000 EXP points, the
     highest amount in the entire game. You can run up and down this hall to
     respawn/replace enemies, so you don't have to fight any other creatures in
     order to specifically spot a Tokotocold enemy.

Use the teleport at the far north end to reach the final hallway of the tower.
Save your game at the waypoint and prepare yourself for three consecutive
battles that aren't going to be easy.

| BOSS FIGHT: CASSIOPEIA |
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  STATS:   3380 HP, Weak against: ---, Resists: Physical
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯   Steal: Diva's Mantle

  ATTACKS: 1. Physical Attack [Minor to Medium Damage]
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ 2. Pillars of Darkness [Ranged attack, Use Defend or avoid]
           3. Star Bolt [Single Target, Medium Damage, Use Defend]
           4. Fallen Star [All Targets, Major Damage, Use Defend &
                           All-Out Defense]
           5. Nightshade [Used after dropping below 50% HP, Permanently changes
                          attack style into offensive]

The fight against Cassiopeia isn't too easy, but since she has a low amount of
HP, it's important not to fight too defensively either. Cassiopeia will attack
either offensively or defensively depending on the color of her stripes. Red
indicated an offensive stance, while blue marks a defensive stance.

You'll want to perform All-Out Attacks when there's little risk of getting hurt
by Cassiopeia's most powerful attack, Fallen Star, against which you'll always
want to defend (and have an All-Out Defense already going). If Cassiopeia has
her blue stripes on, certainly use All-Out Attacks; conversely, if her red
stripes show, play defensively and use All-Out Defense along with healing. As
soon as Fallen Star is being prepared, Defend yourself against it to minimize
the hurt.

Her other attacks are fairly strong, but not nearly as worrisome. Star Bolt is
easily defended against, her physical attacks can be avoided by casting spells
from a distance, and Pillars of Darkness is a powerful attack but you can see
where it's going to hit. Do be sure to defend against it if possible.

Nightshade is actually a change in temper, and you'll want to go All-Out while
she casts this, but afterward it's best to keep playing defensively until the
end of the battle. As the end of the fight draws nearer, heal your party's HP
and MP with healing items, because the second battle begins right after this
one.

| BOSS FIGHT: White Witch |
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  STATS:   9800 HP, Weak against: ---, Resists: ---
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯   Steal: Werewolf Claws

  ATTACKS: 1. Physical Attacks [Various attacks; Medium Damage]
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ 2. Wrathful Rush [Single Target, Use Defend!]
           3. Harrowing Horns [Closeby targets, Medium Damage, Try to avoid,]
           4. Death Drop [Ranged, Closeby Targets, Major Damage,
                          Use Defend!, Try to avoid,
           5. Annihilation [Moving Beam Attack, Major Damage, Use Defend!]

This fight is likely to last much longer than the previous, if only because of
the White Witch's big leap in terms of HP. Lick your wounds from the previous
fight, but only after defending against the possible first move the witch may
prepare; Death Drop. This is a nasty and greatly damaging attack that hits
everyone in the area nearby.

Winning this battle becomes easier when you know that the offensive/defensive
stance carries over in this battle, so play offensively when her stripes are
blue, and defensively when her stripes are red.

You'll also want watch out for Annihilation. The White Witch will first radiate
red and charge up, then leap back and perform the beam, which moves around the
area. It's possible to cancel or avoid it by standing besides her, but if that
fails, definitely try to defend against it.

Winning the battle is easier if you take things easy. Don't go in for that quick
win and keep your distance, spamming medium spells like Arrow of Light with
Oliver. The Witch will likely chase you around the field, allowing the others
to get in some damage while you spam magic and heal whenever necessary with
spells or provisions.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Fortunately, you are fully healed after these two battles, although the next
does immediately follow.

| BOSS FIGHT: ZODIARCH + SATELLITES |
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  STATS:   12500 HP, Weak against: ---, Resists: ---
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯   Steal: ---

           Satellite: 1500 HP each

  ATTACKS: 1. Physical Attack [Medium to Major Damage, Try to avoid]
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ 2. Sigh of Sorrow [Ranged, Inflicts Sleep]
           3. Piercing Gaze [One Target, Lowers stats]
           4. Shockblast [Ranged, Major Damage, Try to avoid or use Defend!]
           5. Chaos [All Targets, Heavy Damage, Use Defend & All-Out Defense!]

  REWARDS: 8200 EXP, 6500 G
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
The Zodiarch and its Satellites are certainly vigorous foes, but with the right
tactics even a fairly low-level party can take them out. You'll definitely want
to use powerful MP (and HP) healing items during this battle, such as Nostrums
and Sprite items.

At the start of the battle, immediately order an All-Out Defense and Defend with
Oliver, as Zodiarch will use Chaos, a powerful attack that you don't want to
suffer defenseless. Cassiopeia will be fighting alongside you and try to prevent
the Zodiarch from casting it again by using Nix; however, this takes a while to
charge, so you'll need to protect her from the nasty Satellites.

The best way to do this is to keep your distance with Oliver and perform a
couple of castings of Astra (or Evenstar, if that's all you have). This saps
your MP enormously, so use a Nostrum when your magic juices run low.

You'll still have to deal with the Zodiarch's other attacks, of which Shockblast
is by far its most powerful and annoying, not in the least place because he
usually performs it as a follow up on Chaos, which is particularly lethal.
Prepare to defend against both attacks, and if things go terribly wrong, use a
Phoenix Tear or Breath if absolutely required.

When Zodiarch is stunned by Nix, immediately perform an All-Out Attack in the
hopes of getting some damage in, and possibly even a golden glim.

As with the last battle, play fairly defensively and destroy the Satellites as
soon as possible, preferably with magic or tricks that hit all targets on the
battlefield. Zodiarch will frequently use its Piercing Gaze attack (usually on
the character you're controlling), which lowers your stats. It's more an
annoyance than a real threat, but you can nonetheless boost the rest of your
party's defenses with a spell such as Ward, slightly improving their magical
defense.

Keep your party healthy with group-healing items, keep Oliver at a distance,
and keep your wit to win this battle eventually.

                        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
One of the big questions from RPG gamers is always: "Which items are unique,
which are missable, and what do I have to absolutely have to keep in mind in
order to (eventually) still get a perfect inventory?" In Ni no Kuni this is
fortunately much easier than in various other RPG's. Below you'll find the short
list of unique and permanently missable items, along with what you must watch
out for not to waste your potential perfect save file. 

NOTE: We believe this list is complete, HOWEVER, we are human and capable of 
¯¯¯¯¯ making mistakes. If you think something is missing from this list,
      please inform us immediately.

'——————————————————————'———————————————————————————————————————————————————————'

IMPORTANT: While it doesn't warrant an entire section on its own, it's also
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ important to know that certain enemy entries in your enemy
           encyclopedia can be permanently missed. The relevant entries are
           [387-396], which are all a "Wretch" type. These are fought near the
           end of the game in various towns. Once you go beyond a certain point
           in the story (it will be obvious when this is) you can never fight
           them again. Either get at least one of each, or, if you're aiming for
           hardcore perfection, maximize the counter for each of them.
